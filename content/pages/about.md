## The American Coyote

According to the legends of North America's First Nations people, when
humans began to walk the earth, it was the coyote who taught them how to
survive.

Then European settlers moved in and transformed the continent. Many wild
animals were driven into extinction but coyotes thrived. Today scientists
consider them an evolutionary marvel - an animal of a thousand faces capable of adapting to a thousand different ecosystems.

The idea of trying to eliminate coyotes has been tried for in excess of 100 years. They've been poisoned, trapped, shot - they have tried everything to get rid of them. They're virtually impossible to eliminate. No other animal has ever survived such a massive attempt to wipe them out.

The animal is very adaptable, very intelligent and very opportunistic and
they recognize a good thing when they see it. Coyote size is key to their adaptability: they can take down a young pronghorn or survive on insects and berries. To survive, coyotes quickly adopt new tricks: becoming more unpredictable and always on the lookout. They're flexible in their habits and will move up or down the food chain. They breed rapidly when under attack.

This coyote has learned that being fast, bold and cautious is the only way to survive alongside the wolves - coyotes need to keep a safe
distance from the wolf packs but they also want to remain as close as
they can to rich and very dependable sources of food deliberately tempting
death has made them more cunning and extremely adaptable.

This risk-taking has made coyotes more prolific. Breeding alphas are killed constantly, forcing coyotes to reproduce at a rapid rate, but with more food more pups will survive to adulthood. Coyotes seem to have evolved a specialized set of population tools to compensate and rebound very rapidly. In fact, it almost seems to be that _they do better in a state of flux_: they've evolved to this constant mortality factor.

## I, Coyote

This site is inspired, both in design and content, by the infamous, "wily" coyote.

I identify with the versatility, resiliency, adaptability, dynamism, ubiquity, redundancy, antifragility and risk-taking of the coyote. 

This site, [coyote.life](https://coyote.life) will be a digital journal about the wide array of physical, intellectual, or spiritual adventures that I undertake living a coyote-style life, as well as reference materials useful in such activity. 

## Guidelines

There are some standards on plan to follow with the content of this site. 

### Current and Prospective

There is obviously a lot one has already experienced by the time he gets to the point to start writing about it and sharing it on the internet. Although there is lots I would like to add regarding past experiences, I will not do so on this site. All content will be current thoughts and experiences, or in the case of notes and reference materials, things that provide ongoing tangible value-add or are of on going interest. 

The past is the past, and this site didn't exist in the past; therefore retrospective content won't exist on this site. I will not add any former works or writings to this site "for the record." This project is foremost a personal one, not to prove anything to anyone else. 

### Informal & Uncensored

This site will be a messy, catch-all drawer, not a scientific journal, formal debate stage, or politically correct publication. I plan to move fast, and add content insofar as it satisfies my desire to put the thoughts onto paper. This does not involve grammatical knit-picking or appeals to authority via citations. Think colloquial - grammatically questionable, and sans citations.

### Personal

Content will be both deep and shallow, and everything in between. It may seem scattered and distracted, but at the end of the day, it's for my own fulfillment and quest to freedom of thought and aggregation. 

This is not work; this is leisure activity. As soon as I'm no longer intrigued by an idea or topic, I'll move on. I want this project to last, and thus it must be sustainable, and forcing myself to do something I'm not motivated by in my spare time is not sustainable. Expect half-baked work. 

### Original and Additive

I will make an effort _not_ to duplicate knowledge or repeat or refactor the works or words of others. Duplication and reproduction is not only unproductive, but also contradicts the principles of open-source work and knowledge that I believe in. If the works of another have been particularly interesting or impactful to me and I wish to further explore and discuss, I will _build upon_ them, as an expansion, not rebuild them.
