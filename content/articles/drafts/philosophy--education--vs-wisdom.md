Title: In the Fray with Knowledge and Wisdom
Category: philosophy/education

Wisdom is competence with regard to the complex realities of life. It is not simple-minded or reductionist. Wisdom comes before good intentions: good intentions are first-order, wisdom second.


> Education makes the wise slightly wiser, but it makes the fool vastly more dangerous.
