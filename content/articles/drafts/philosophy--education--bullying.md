# Popularity and Persecution

Not all bullying (specifically _persecution_ among children) is driven by popularity. Bullying will happen independently of the popularity complex.

> Partly because teenagers are still half children, and many children are just intrinsically cruel. Some torture nerds for the same reason they pull the legs off spiders. Before you develop a conscience, torture is amusing.

Nonetheless, bullying is a integral part of the popularity system. So why is bullying a part the mechanism of popularity? Because

> Kids persecute nerds to make themselves feel better. When you tread water, you lift yourself up by pushing water down. Likewise, in any social hierarchy, people unsure of their own position will try to emphasize it by maltreating those they think rank below... Most of the persecution comes from [semi-popular] kids, the nervous middle classes.

Furthermore, the distribution of kids is skew-normal, or pear-shaped when viewed vertically. So there are a lot more people making nerds unpopular (a.k.a. picking on them) than there are nerds.

But what is the deeper motivation for this?

> Popularity is only partially about individual attractiveness. It’s much more about alliances. To become more popular, you need to be constantly doing things that bring you close to other popular people, and nothing brings people closer than a common enemy... By singling out and persecuting a nerd, a group of kids from higher in the hierarchy create bonds between themselves... They don’t actually hate [nerds]. They just need something to chase.

What makes the system worse is the self-perpetuating nature of popularity. Once a kid gets made a target, kids would not otherwise persecute become afraid to associate themselves with them. Thus the persecution, when direct or indirect, builds.

> Unpopularity is a communicable disease; kids too nice to pick on nerds will still ostracize them in self-defense.

Thus the system of popularity, where kids become popular by condoning the unpopularity of others, resembles a _zero-sum game_. We can't all win. We can't all be popular. To be popular means other kids aren't popular.

# Degeneration and Rebellion

Hierarchies of real people can and do form in the real world around all sorts of criteria. Most hierarchies have a purpose and a logical structure to achieve that purpose. The most obvious example of this is in large corporations and the military.

But in high school there is no objective that the social hierarchy needs to accomplish. Thus, "the situation degenerates into a popularity contest."

> Instead of depending on some real test, one’s rank depends mostly on one’s ability to increase one’s rank. When there is some real external test of skill, it isn’t painful to be at the bottom of the hierarchy.

Furthermore, in this hierarchy, it is _painful_ to be at the bottom of the hierarchy, because the _zero-sum_ popularity system that drives it. This isn't the case in most other hierarchies.
