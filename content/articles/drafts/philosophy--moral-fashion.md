# The Creation of Moral Fashion

Moral fashions and taboos (the antithesis of fashion) are often generated in connection with power struggles. And the most aggressive and potent struggles for power are carried out by

> Groups [that are] poised halfway between weakness and power.

Nervous and unsettled groups need protection, because they are vulnerable and could quickly fall into frailty. At the same time, the have just enough influence to be able to create and enforce a moral fashion or taboo.

To identify the core moral fashions such groups surround and attempt to guard (with ideological fascism), ask

> What groups are powerful but nervous, and what ideas would they like to suppress? What ideas were tarnished by association when they ended up on the losing side of a recent struggle?

# Why Care About Fashions

We should care about recognizing moral fashions, or more generally, _intellectual_ fashions or taboos ("the unthinkable") , because

> Great work tends to grow out of ideas that others have overlooked, and no idea is so overlooked as one that’s unthinkable.

Shaky, or in previous terminology, "nervous" ideology is a great target for groundbreaking revolution. Good intellectuals

> look for places where conventional wisdom is broken, and then try to pry apart the cracks and see what’s underneath.

This phenomenon is not just for intellectuals questioning the political or scientific establishment.

> In any competitive field, you can win big by seeing things that others aren’t... small trips outside the box [are what] people call innovative.

# Living as an Ideological Outsider

It's a service to the progress of society to be an ideological non-conformist and skeptic. How can you live a normal life as one?

> Pick your battles... argue with idiots, become an idiot.

But never stop thinking. Master the ability to _think_ boundlessly and discipline outward expression.

> Draw a sharp line between your thoughts and your speech. Inside your head, anything is allowed... Smile at everyone, but don't tell them what you're thinking.

If the scale of time is unable to give you a proper view of the relativism of popular fashion (in the case of a brand new topic or moral theme, the likes of which mankind has never been faced with or considered), you can do it in the moment by

> Create[ing] distance yourself. Instead of being part of the mob, stand as far away from it as you can and watch what it’s doing. And pay especially close attention whenever an idea is being suppressed... How can you see the wave, when you’re the water?



If pressed for an answer or opinion,

> the best policy is to make it plain that you don’t agree with whatever zealotry is current in your time, but not to be too specific about what you disagree with.   

Chances are, whatever questions people argue intensely over in their time, are more complicated than a "yes or no" or "for or against." Don't cater to the denial of complicated system by giving the crowd of simple and close-minded zealots the simple answer they want.

Another way to avoid personal confrontation and being labelled a heretic is to
