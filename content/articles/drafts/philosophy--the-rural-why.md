Title: The Rural Why
Category: philosophy

A defense and explanation of the pursuit of a free, rural life, inspired by a work of similar motivation, but for the classic practice and art of fishing, [The River Why](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_River_Why). 

Those living in cities or along the culturally different and more populated area of the coasts often speak of rural folks in "flyover" country with disdain, condescension, and even resentment, due the recent political election outcomes. Even with very little first hand (primary) experience with rural culture or people, the rural lifestyle is often wholly written off as ignorant, primitive, uncultured, and named with derogatory slang (left as an exercise to the reader).

The rural cultures deserves more than the judgments and labels, and while many of the stereotypes exists for a reason, there is more to it than meets the eye. The labels and unfounded assumptions are picked out, isolated, and addressed, one by one. 

## Assumption: Asocial, Escapist, Reclusive

Places aren't lonely: people are. With the rampant superficiality, posturing, and materialism American cities are famous for, Americans struggle with mental health and loneliness more than ever.

As generally accepted by economics (not that the social sciences make it or break it), people value each unit of something based on how many units they have. Per unit value goes up as units possessed goes down. We have more contact as individuals with the rest of humanity than we've ever had.  
 
 This, in my anecdotal experience and also some metropolitan stereotypes (cough New York), leads to massive disrespect and impatience, even to totally unknown strangers in public places. 
 
 People are everywhere, and thus the worth of each person or interaction goes down. It isn't just etiquette that is lost in this adjustment of value: helping a stranger in need or distress becomes a more foreign concept, as people [assume the system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bystander_effect) will deal with the issue. This phenomenon leads to generally less compassion for equals and the degeneration of the neighborhood and community, once key structures to Western society.

But in rural areas, the good samaritan tradition lives on. Coherent, value-bound neighborhoods exist, for the uplifting companionship at best, if strictly for reciprocated assistance during urgent situations at worst.  

## Assumption: Uneducated and Ignorant

Statistically speaking, this is true. However, once again, there's is only so much that can be assigned a value and counted. "Education" is one of those abstractions. While 


## Assumption: Poor and Incapable 

In the world, not of it.

Although rural populations do indeed possess less, there is more appreciation and contentment. There is less envy: it's more about what you have and how it serves you, not an endless comparison game with focus on what others have. 

In principal: rural living emphasize what one _has_, not what one has not.

The rural life offer freedom from materialism and comparison, while urban and suburban areas may be rich in resources but consumed by consumerism and excess. Free from the crushing societal pressures of conformity, image-based judgement, and the bloat of the politics of large government and organizations, rural folks stay within their means and are generally more resourceful and self-reliant, if for no other reason than the relative lack of safety and comfort infrastructure on which the consumption and blunder feed.

In the age of globalism, the worth of a society is derived by economics measurements like payroll, un/-employment and production and bureaucratic flab like certificates and degrees, rural areas certainly fall behind. But these metrics are not a perfect proxy of the satisfaction, fulfillment, joy, or peace. In fact, the human race is richer _and_ more discontent than it's ever been. Rural living helps one escape that equation and rat race entirely.

## Time Aplenty

Time is the most valuable resource. And away from the hurry and hustle of urban life, it can be fully appreciated. 

The pursuit for more, more, more and the excess discounts the value of time, _time discounting_.
