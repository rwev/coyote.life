Title: Rationality

Despite the popular view that faith and rationality are incompatible, the discussion of mind and heart and rationality and emotion carries throughout the Bible. What does the Word have to say about something that it's often convicted of lacking?


*We will lead our hearts or be led by them*

Proverbs TODO

Jesus spoke of heaven _relationally_, not _locationally_.


Enter through the narrow gate. For wide is the gate and broad is the road that leads to destruction, and many enter through it. 14 But small is the gate and narrow the road that leads to life, and only a few find it.
Matthew 7: 13-14

Earth is a close to heaven as one will ever get is Jesus isn't their Lord.


Knowledge != Power. Action on knowledge makes the truth complete. 
We can be sure that we know Him if we obey His teaching. 4 Anyone who says, “I know Him,” but does not obey His teaching is a liar. There is no truth in him. 5 But whoever obeys His Word has the love of God made perfect in him. This is the way to know if you belong to Christ. 6 The one who says he belongs to Christ should live the same kind of life Christ lived.
1 John 2:3-6

You can never keep what isn't yours. God purchased us.

Jesus' command are not exercises of his power or to keep us at bay and from living in fullness -- but to bless us. We have to walk in obedience to receive it. It is _opportunity_ for fullness.



Worldly, secular approaches to emotional and spiritual health are inherently reductionist. The narratives of following one's emotions, that one's emotions define and even the scientifically invalid claim that emotions are what define the human experience as the peak consciousness are the secular take on the matter. 

But we're not just a body, or our emotions, not will, not conscience, or just thinking.

Rationality as a Biblical consequence, as the only creatures to be made with a soul and and the image of God, we are the only creatures possessing rationality: sensing cause and effect on an intellectual, contemplative level, the ability to deliberate and plan, to have foresight and act strategically, the extrapolate the course of events beyond the immediate moment or decision, and deeper than any instinct. 

All other creatures do not possess rationality on specimen level: the genetic pool and natural selection operates and evolves into rational solution and the genetic pool feels the forces of cause and effect, but it isn't consciously aware of them. 

Rationality is what makes us _more_ like God, and different from Beasts, not the other way around: there are creatures throughout the animal kingdom who feel emotion on an individual level, such as an orca or cow who has lost a calf. Rationality allows us to control our emotions and the recklessness of impulse, and to measure and fit our circumstances into the scheme of eternity, not the present situation. Rationality is the characteristic of God that gives us dominance over our animal side. 

Perhaps when God gave Man dominion over the fish of the sea, birds of the air, and beasts of the field, he gave us control over our inner beasts too.
