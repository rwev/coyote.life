Title: Noninterventionism

> Thomas Jefferson, in his first inaugural address, called for "peace, commerce, and honest friendship with all nations, entangling alliances with none."
> George Washington, in his Farewell address: "harmony, liberal intercourse with all nations, are recommended by policy, humanity, interest... but even our commercial policy should hold an equal and impartial hand; neither seeking nor granting exclusive favors or preferences... the great rule of
> conduct for us in regard to foreign nations is in extending our commercial relations, to have with them as little political connection as possible... Why quit our own to stand upon foreign ground? Why, by interweaving our destiny with that of any part of Europe, entangle our peace and
> prosperity in the toils of European ambition, rivalship, interest, humor and caprice."

According to Ron Paul, "The principles enschrined in the constitution do not change. If anything, today's more complex world cries out for the moral clarity of a noninterventionist foreign policy."
