## Of Software and Skoolies


> Moving forward, [we] had no plans, no budget, no timetable, working on projects whenever it made sense. Often, that has meant waiting until they stumble on something that inspires. "We definitely come from the standpoint of doing things with materials that just happen to come our way."

This is critical to keeping projects engaging, rewarding, and joyful. Getting into the mindset of _grinding_ a project out, whether a piece of software, or a school bus renovation, or, in their case, an off-grid cabin build, is not sustainable, nor fun. It's all about the journey, not the destination - something our fast and impatient culture doesn't promote. Successful, long-lived projects are fun projects. 

> I intentionally ignored the rest of the world when it comes to treehouses. I did no research whatsoever. I wanted to build it entirely from my own ideas. I wanted it to feel like it was entirely mine. If you're not looking at a book telling you how to do it, then every possibility is open to you. <p class="annotation">Ethan Schlussler, Treehouses, Cabin Porn</p>


Eric Raymond writes in his essay _The Cathedral & The Bazaar_ about the success of the open-source movement:

> Human beings generally take pleasure in a task when it falls in a sort of optimal-challenge zone; no so easy as to be boring, not too hard to achieve. A happy programmer is one who is neither underutilized nor weighed down with ill-formulated goals and stressful process friction. _Enjoyment predicts efficiency_.
> Joy, humor, and playfulness are indeed assets... it is not mere joke that the Linux mascot is a cuddly, neotenous penguin.
> It may well turn out that one of the most important effects of open source's success will be to _teach us that play is the most economically efficient mode of creative work.

Work, and its measurements of productivity and efficiency, don't need to be confined to their cold corner with rigid German engineer types. The best work isn't necessarily accomplished top-down with a plan, a budget, and a timetable. A better method, both in the quality of work done, and the experience of the maker, is to follow to ebb & flow of creativity and inspiration.

> So many of our plans [change]. Slowing it down has been great for really understanding what's important to us. A lot of people get wrapped up in thinking things need to be more grand than they have to be. If you keep things really basic, you can start enjoying the place sooner. <p class="annotation">Cabin Porn, Fixer Uppers</p>


> He wanted to consider the intentions of the previous architects rather than dominate the site with his own independent scheme. "The beautiful thing about architecture is there is a constant dialogue _inside_ the work itself. You don't have any choice but to embrace that."

> Dave wanted to channel Frank Lloyd Wright's idea of _eliminating the insignificant_... Wright would give himself so much information, and then he would just start pulling it all, removing it and taking the design back down to the bare essentials. <p class="annotation">Cabin Porn, Modern</p>
