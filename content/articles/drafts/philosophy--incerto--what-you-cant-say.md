## What You Can't Say
Essay #3 in the collection.

Paul explains how just as there are fashions in clothing, music, and other superficial products of the modern economy, there are_ moral_ fashions.

> If you could travel back in a time machine, one thing would be true no matter where you went: you’d have to watch what you said.
 
Statements we consider as basic fact today were at some point in time heretical and blasphemous (examples to follow). In more cases than not, such revolutionary (looking from our time, not theirs) claims were made by, what we would consider today, nerds.

> Nerds are always getting in trouble. They say improper things
for the same reason they dress unfashionably and have good ideas.
Convention has less hold over them
Innovators of the past had to fight against popular opinion to reveal scientific truths, we have to do the same today. Unfortunately, in our modern era, just like _every other era in history,_ people like to think that we are not vulnerable to such ignorance and blinded by our own fashions.

> It would be a remarkable coincidence if ours were the first era to get everything just right.
#### Fashions

> Fashion is mistaken for good design; moral fashion is mistaken for good.

Fashions (_def.: a popular or the latest style) _all all kinds are random, and unrecognizable to most people, as most people are not cognizant of the trends of the past. However,

> [Violating clothing fashions] gets you laughed at. Violating moral fashions can get you fired, ostracized, imprisoned, or even killed.

Paul then outlines several methods to objectively identify whether you or any given individual is following moral fashion.

#### Identifying Fashion-Following: _The Conformist Test_

> Do you have any opinions that you would be reluctant to express in front of a group of your peers?

If yes, congratulations. You're likely not a conformist by willing to recognize, however unpopular it is to do so, that the popular moral environment contains errors.

If no, then you effectively believe everything the popular wave wants you to. At this point, there are two possible explanations.

> Odds are you just think whatever you’re told.

They less likely explanation is that

> You independently considered every question and came up with the exact same answers that are now considered acceptable.

Because the societal consensus moral map contains mistakes, just like any other era of history, any individual makes the same mistakes in the moral map out of happenstance isn't convincing: just like a copied geographical map will contain the same intentional mistakes that were planted there by the original cartographer.

#### Identifying Fashion-Following: _The Trouble Test_
Another way we can identify fashions is to look at what someone can do to get laughed at or even ostracized. _What we can't say_ is a often a product of the moral map society is following at the tie.

> Keep track of opinions that get people in trouble, and start asking, could this be true? Ok, it may be heretical (or whatever modern equivalent), but might it also be true?

Obviously true or obviously false statements or ideas don't get people in trouble. Statements on the edge do: statements that _set questioning into movement. _They are not obviously true or false, but rather require further consideration.

#### Identifying Fashion-Following: _The Heresy Test_
For this test of fashion following, look for the_ application of labels _as a method of dismissal for provocative thought.

> In every period of history, there seem to have been labels that got applied to statements to shoot them down before anyone had a chance to ask if they were true or not.

This is particularly useful in the "Identity Politics" of the recent American elections (2016).

> In any period, it should be easy to figure out what such labels are, simply by looking at what people call ideas they disagree with besides untrue. 
    <br> 
    When a politician says his opponent is mistaken, that’s a straightforward criticism, but when he attacks a statement a “divisive” or “racially insensitive” instead of arguing that it’s false, we should start paying attention.

Applying labels that are a purely plays on what society may find provides emotional and intellectual security are telltale signs of a section of the current moral map may be vulnerable.

> If a statement is false, that’s the worst thing you can say about it. You don’t need to say that it’s heretical (i.e. label-and-dismiss it)

But when you here labels being apply to statements, _ask why_.

#### Identifying Fashion-Following: _The Time & Space Test_

We can look at the changes in society's moral map over time to identify beliefs that can be potential suspects.

> Another way to figure out what we’re getting wrong is to look at what used to be acceptable and is now unthinkable.

I say _suspects_ because of the potential for false positives. In total, society has gotten closer to a more objectively improved moral map. Slavery, for example, was once considered normal, and is now considered unthinkable. But many other changes in popular belief are not as cut-and-dry.

Science is the clearest. The field is always driven closer and closer to the truths of the universe, with no real fluctuation.

> In a field like physics, if we disagree with past generations it’s because we’re right and they’re wrong.

But in politics and popular morality,

> Many changes are just fashion. The age of consent fluctuates like hemlines.

Because morality, however you would think about measuring, fluctuates, instead of climbing (or diving, if you're a pessimist), society cannot possibly always be improving. All societies in the past held views which were wrong; some more than others.

In general, it is arrogant to assume that were remain superior to all societies of history, and are excluded from such error. We must recognize

> People in past times were much like us... Whatever their ideas were, they were ideas reasonable people could believe.

If the scale of time is unable to give you a proper view of the relativism of popular fashion (in the case of a brand new topic or moral theme, the likes of which mankind has never been faced with or considered), you can do it in the moment by

> Create[ing] distance yourself. Instead of being part of the mob, stand as far away from it as you can and watch what it’s doing. And pay especially close attention whenever an idea is being suppressed... How can you see the wave, when you’re the water?

#### The Creation of Moral Fashion

Moral fashions and taboos (the antithesis of fashion) are often generated in connection with power struggles. And the most aggressive and potent struggles for power are carried out by

> Groups [that are] poised halfway between weakness and power.

Nervous and unsettled groups need protection, because they are vulnerable and could quickly fall into frailty. At the same time, the have just enough influence to be able to create and enforce a moral fashion or taboo.

To identify the core moral fashions such groups surround and attempt to guard (with ideological fascism), ask

> What groups are powerful but nervous, and what ideas would they like to suppress? What ideas were tarnished by association when they ended up on the losing side of a recent struggle?

#### Why Care About Fashions

We should care about recognizing moral fashions, or more generally, _intellectual_ fashions or taboos ("the unthinkable") , because

> Great work tends to grow out of ideas that others have overlooked, and no idea is so overlooked as one that’s unthinkable.

Shaky, or in previous terminology, "nervous" ideology is a great target for groundbreaking revolution. Good intellectuals

> look for places where conventional wisdom is broken, and then try to pry apart the cracks and see what’s underneath.

This phenomenon is not just for intellectuals questioning the political or scientific establishment.

> In any competitive field, you can win big by seeing things that others daren’t... small trips outside the box [are what] people call innovative.

#### Living as an Ideological Outsider

It's a service to the progress of society to be an ideological non-conformist and skeptic. How can you live a normal life as one?

> Pick your battles... argue with idiots, become an idiot.

But never stop thinking. Master the ability to _think_ boundlessly and discipline outward expression.

> Draw a sharp line between your thoughts and your speech. Inside your head, anything is allowed... Smile at everyone, but don't tell them what you're thinking.

If pressed for an answer or opinion,

> the best policy is to make it plain that you don’t agree with whatever zealotry is current in your time, but not to be too specific about what you disagree with.   

Chances are, whatever questions people argue intensely over in their time, are more complicated than a "yes or no" or "for or against." Don't cater to the denial of complicated system by giving the crowd of simple and close-minded zealots the simple answer they want.

Another way to avoid personal confrontation and being labelled a heretic is to

> Ratchet the debate up one level of abstraction.   

For example, instead of debating whether some governmental organization should censor some political extremist group, don't get involved in the details of the specific case. Don't feed the bias and give momentum to the popular answer. Instead, discuss censorship in general.
