Title: Libertarianism

> When I say liberty I do no simply mean what is referred to as "free enterprise". I mean the liberty of the individual to think his own thoughts and live his own life as he desires to think and live... (the) liberty of a man to develop his ideas and get other people to teach those ideas, if he can
 convince them that they have some value to the world; liberty of every local community to decide how its children should be educated, how its local services shall be run... the liberty of a man to choose his own occupation; and liberty of a man to run his own business as he thinks it ought to be
  run, as long as he does not interfere with the right of other people to do the same thing. <p class="annotation">Robert Taft</p>


According to Ron Paul, libertarianism "is a peaceful continuation of the American Revolution and the principles of our Founding Fathers: liberty, self-government, the Constitution, and noninterventionist foreign policy."
