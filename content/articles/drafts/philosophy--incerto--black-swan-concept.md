My attempt at [grokking]() NNT's book, _The Black Swan_. 

The Black Swan analagy

> illustrates a severe limitation to our learning from observations or experience and the fragility of out knowledge. One single observation can invalidate a general statement [all swans are white] derived from millennia of confirmatory sightings of millions of white. All you need is one single black bird...  it is about the oversize role of extreme events in many domains in life. 
>

1. an _outlier_, lying outside the realm of expectations, because nothing in the past can convincingly point to its possibility,
2. carries extreme impact, 
3, in spite of outlier status, human nature [hubris, man's search for meaning and making sense of the world] makes us concoct explanations for its occurrence after the fact, making it "explainable and predictable" -> retrospective predictability

> the central idea... concerns our blindness with respect to randomness, particularly the large deviations...
>
> It is easy to see that life is the cumulative effect of a handful of significant shocks... Look into your own existence. Count the significant events... how many of them came on a schedule [according to plan]?

> Black swan logic makes _what you don't know_ far more relevant that what you do know... The black swan is the result of epistemic limitations (distortions), mostly confidence in knowledge. 


> the payoff of a human venture is in general inversely proportional to what it is expected to be... The more unexpected the success of such a venture, the smaller number of competitors, and the more successful the entrepreneur who implements the idea.
>

> _the inability to predict outliers implies to inability to predict the course of history... but we act as though we are able to predict... Owing to this misunderstanding of the causal chains between policy and actions, we can easily trigger black swans thanks to _aggressive ignorance_, like a child playing with a chemistry kit. 

>Black swans being unpredictable, we need to adjust to their existence rather than naively try to predict them... Indeed, in some domains, such as scientific discovery and venture capital investments, there is a disproportionate payoff from the unknown, since you typically have little to lose and plenty to gain. 

>We will see that, contrary to social science wisdom, almost no discovery, no technologies of note, came from [foremost] from design and planning -- the were just Black Swans. The strategy for discoverers and entrepreneurs is to rely less on top-down planning and focus on maximum tinkering and recognizing opportunities as they present themselves... the reason free markets work is because they allow a few people to be lucky, thanks to aggressive trial and error, not by giving rewards or incentives for skills. The strategy is then, to tinker as much as possible and try to collect as many Black Swan opportunities as you can. 

> the story of the maginot line shows how we are conditioned to be specific... the French, after the Great War, built a wall along the previous German invasion route to prevent reinvasion- Hitler just went effortlessly around it. The French were excellent students of history; they just learned with too much precision... we do not spontaneously learn that we don't learn that we don't learn. The problem lies in the structure of our minds: we don't learn rules [guidelines], just facts. Metarules (such as the rule that we have a tendency to not learn rules) we don't seem to be good at getting.

> Everyone body knows that you need more prevention than treatment, but few reward acts of prevention. We glorify those who left the names in our history books at the expense of those contributors about whom our books are silent. We humans are not just a superficial race; we are a very unfair one. << OBSCURITY.

> Platonicity is our tendency to mistake the map for the territory, to focus on pure and well-defined "forms"... When these ideas and crisp constructs inhabit our minds, we privilege them over other less elegant objects, those with messier and less tractable structures. Platonicity is what makes us think that we understand more than we actually do... the Platonic Fold is the explosive boundary where the Platonic mindset enters in contact with messy reality, where the gap between what you know and what you think you know becomes dangerously wide. 

> Categorizing always produces reduction in true complexity... Any reduction f the world around us can have explosive consequences since it rules out sources of uncertainly; it drives us to a misunderstanding of the fabric of the world [reality].

Humans, in the desire for intellectual comfort to, to narrate the world and make sense of events, to find meaning, try to explain and categorize, when, in reality, it's all far to complicated and chaotic for one to make sense of it all without excessive reductionism. This reduction and loss of knowledge and wisdom when we fit reality to our mental models often does more harm than good. 

> the beats is not just the bell curve or the self-deceiving statistician or the Platonified scholar... it is [man's] drive to "focus" on what makes sense to us. Living on the planet today requires a lot more imagination than we are made to have... Our world is dominated by the extreme, the unknown, and the very improbable (according to current knowledge), and all the while we focus on the known and the repeated... We need to use the extreme event as a starting point, and not treat it as an exception to be swept under the rug... in spite of our progress and growth in knowledge, or perhaps because of such progress and growth, the future will be increasingly less predictable, while both human nature and social science seem to conspire to hide the idea from us. 

> Anti-scholar: someone who focuses on the unread books [in his library], and makes an attempt not to treat his knowledge as a treasure, or even a possession or even a self-esteem enhancement device -- a skeptical empiricist [who doesn't take what he knows too seriously]... We tend to treat our knowledge as personal property to be protected and defended.

## History and the Triplet of Opacity

History is opaque. You see what comes out, not the script that produces events, the generator of history. There is a fundamental incompleteness in your grasp of such events, since you do not see what's inside the box, how the mechanisms work. What I call the generator of historical events is different from the events themselves, much as the minds of the gods cannot be read just by witnessing their deeds. You are very likely to be fooled by their intentions.

>The human mind suffers from three ailments as it comes in contact with history, what I call the triplet of opacity:

1. The _illusion of understanding_, or how everyone thinks he know what is going on in a world that is more complicated (or random, distinctly) than they realize
2. the retrospective distortion (and plausibility), or how we can assess matters only after the fact; history seems clearer and more organized in history books than in empirical reality [history books storytell].
3. the overvaluaction of factual information [relative to what is _unknown_] and the handicap of authoritative and learned [as being overconfident in their base of facts]

> Our minds are wonderful explanation machines, capable of making sense out of almost anything, capable of mounting explanations for all matter of phenomena, and generally incapable of accepting the idea of unpredictability... the studious examination of the past in the greatest of detail does not teach you about the Mind of History [as a abstract being and orchestrator]; it only gives you the illusion of understanding it. History and societies do not crawl. They make umps. They go from fracture to fracture [piecewise] with a few vibrations in between. Yet we (and historians) like to believe in the predictable, small incremental [gradual, steady] progression.

## The Problem with the Media & Journalism: Clustering

> journalists tend[ed] to cluster not necessarily around the same opinions but frequently around the same framework of analysis. They assign the same importance to the same sets of circumstances and cut reality into the same categories [a manifestation of Platonicity]... Categorizing is [evolutionarily] necessary for humans, but it becomes pathological when the category is seen as definitive [written in stone], preventing people from considering the fuzziness of boundaries, let alone revising their categories.
>
> If you selected one hundred independent-minded journalists capable of seeing factors in isolation from one another, you would get one hundred different opinions. But the process of having these people report in lockstep caused the dimensionality of the opinion set to shrink considerably -- they converged on opinions and used the same items as caused.
