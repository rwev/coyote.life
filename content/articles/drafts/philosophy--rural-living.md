## Places aren't lonely -- people are

## Living _in_ the world, not _of_ it

## The Treasure of Humans 

## Freedom from Materialism and Comparison

## Extreme SITG

## Raw, Real People



## Staying within Means

## True Freedom and Individuality - No Crushing Peer Pressure / Gov't

## De-Monetization of Daily Life

## An End, Not a Mean
