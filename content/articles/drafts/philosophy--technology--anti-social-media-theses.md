Title: An Anti-Social-Media Manifesto
Category: philosophy


Nailing the proverbial thesis to the on the door of a modern center of secular worship and addiction.

### Fake, Adulterated not Real, Raw

Not only does prevalent social media business model rely on the collection and sale of personal data and the resulting ad revenue, social media on the user level is advertising: users advertise themselves. 

Just as brands and businesses curate and promote, a personal social media account amounts to nothing more than an advertisement for oneself. Just like monetized advertisement, they fosters fraud, comparison, envy, the feeling of lack, and consequently insecurity, instead of contentment, honesty, vulnerability.
 


### Obscurity

Being out of vision, not at the center. Avoiding personal recognition and credit. Scripture points that we should be pursuing obscurity: Jesus hid miracles from disciples and followers, and _avoided_ personal credit. 

 Our culture says the opposite, and this tendency is exacerbated and rewarded by social media.
 
Do good things, and do them with a purely outward heart, regardless of anyone sees or understands and praises you for it. Forget the ego boost or the credit towards your character and reputation.

Freedom comes when we do what we do out of love, not for the positive social posturing. Working out of obscurity removes the pollution of self-glorifying motivation and ulterior motives.

Seasons of Jesus' life were defined by wilderness: the solitude, the peace, transformation times of great introspection and contemplation. We went where no one else is, with nothing to prove to others before or after. 

Social media is fed by the intentional maintenance of self-image, for no other reason than to show this image to online social circle, living loud and publicly, not slowly, quietly, and intentionally. 


Proverbs 12:23   (Read all of Proverbs 12)
Prudent people don't flaunt their knowledge; talkative fools broadcast their silliness.

Proverbs 10:19   (Read all of Proverbs 10)
The more talk, the less truth; the wise measure their words.


Proverbs 13:10   (Read all of Proverbs 13)
Arrogant know-it-alls stir up discord, but wise men and women listen to each other's counsel.

Coming into adulthood, can feel the loss of presence in my life: presence to work, presence to relationships, presence to body and nature. We work and work, occupy every waking moment with a task, not out of curiosity, but anxiety. What if we slowed down, become more curious, and thus present to ourselves, our souls, and our relationships? The life Jesus alluded to: the life of never-ending childhood, fully present, curious, humble, and free. 

Adults are always running, anxious, afraid to slow down, trying to do things alone. 


The words of Jesus get all the attention: what about the culture, lifestyle, pace, activy, the unspoken action?

The best stories in the gospel are in the context of interruption. Presence to surroundings, quiet, wilderness, His Father in Heaven.

## Cheap Talk & Virtue Signaling

Social media, almost by definition, is cheap. It is words on digital media (just like this site). 

But this combined with advertising is a dubious combination: social media lets one paint the picture of themselves, much like a business with a public relations plan, that they want to world to see.

I'm not (so much) interesting in who people want to be, the theoretical, academic version of themselves, but who they _are_. Social media isn't where to find the answers.
