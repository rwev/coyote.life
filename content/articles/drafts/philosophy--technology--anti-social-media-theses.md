Title: An Anti-Social-Media Manifesto
Category: Technology


Nailing the proverbial thesis to the on the door of a modern center of secular worship and addiction.

### Fake, Adulterated not Real, Raw

Curated brand, promotion, nothing more than a personal advertisement, that just as the modern advertising industry does: fosters comparison, envy, and consequently insecurity, instead of contentment, honesty, vulnerability.
 


### Obscurity

Being out of vision, not at the center. Avoiding personal recognition and credit. Scripture points that we should be pursuing obscurity: Jesus hid miracles from disciples and followers, and _avoided_ personal credit. 

 Our culture says the opposite, and this tendency is exacerbated and rewarded by social media.
 
Do good things, and do them with a purely outward heart, regardless of anyone sees or understands and praises you for it. Forget the ego boost or the credit towards your character and reputation.

Freedom comes when we do what we do out of love, not for the positive social posturing. Working out of obscurity removes the pollution of self-glorifying motivation and ulterior motives.

Seasons of Jesus' life were defined by wilderness: the solitude, the peace, transformation times of great introspection and contemplation. We went where no one else is, with nothing to prove to others before or after. 

Social media is fed by the intentional maintenance of self-image, for no other reason than to show this image to online social circle, living loud and publicly, not slowly, quietly, and intentionally.
