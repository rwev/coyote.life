Title: Free Trade's Hidden Devils
Category: philosophy

Free trade, and it's globalism grandfather, is lauded without consent - praised as offering mutually benefits for both sides: jobs in the land of production, cheaper costs in the land of consumption. It is hailed as economic progress, and pursued without relent as the means to the have-it-all end. 

One can't argue with that. Free trade delivers (literally, billions) of tons of goods to the West each year. 

If economics and increased material quality of life is gained, what is the opportunity cost with free trade and globalism? Certainly something must be, if we are to hold economics to its own principles.

## Loss of Localized Production Knowledge

## Loss of Tangible Skills

## Loss of Simple Livelihood

## Loss of the Self-made Fulfillment

## Loss of Economic Independence

This is just what happens in the "land of consumption." But as a globally-conscious citizen, what are the repercussions in the production lands? Free trade skepticism is often written off as nationalism or patriotism, even moreso since Trump. 

Foreign production does indeed offer better jobs to the peoples of less-developed lands. But everything is relative. Those jobs do often pay better than domestic opportunities, but in comparison with Western labor markets, the conditions are often drastically unsafe. 

Cheap foreign production, if measure it on the ruler of Western labor practices, is a result of _exploitation_. Sure, the foreign workers may voluntarily produce at the demand of the West, but often out of desperation. The workers certainly don't reap the same benefits and quality of life for their labor as we do in the west. 

So, import taxes and tariffs aren't just protectionist and isolation, but the decentivize / discourage this exploitation. The fines change the profit and loss equation of outsourcing / offshoring production. Continued offshore production can then be reallocated to address the externalities and negative consequences of globalist free trade - by providing foreign development aid or to retrain workers in "consumption" countries where jobs are lost in the effort to restructure labor market and pivot into .

 also bringing down the networks with a domino effect that propagates to take out their neighbors.  Modern institutions, aware of the systemic danger they present to the ecosystem, they rent-seek and protect themselves with bureaucracy or public
  sympathy. In nature, such an organism
  goes extinct.

  > Organically, systems without top-down controls would specialize progressively, slowly, and over a long time, through trial and error, get the right amount of specialization—not through some bureaucrat using a model... systems make small errors, design makes large ones... letting tinkering work
   slowly would lead to efficiency— true efficiency. The role of policy makers should be to, via negativa style, allow the emergence of specialization by preventing what hinders the process.
  
  > This also explains why I found current ideas on globalization (such as those promoted by the journalist Thomas Friedman) one step too naïve, and too dangerous for society—unless one takes into account side effects. Globalization might give the appearance of efficiency, but the operating leverage and the degrees of interaction between parts will cause small cracks
    in one spot to percolate through the entire system. The result would be like a brain experiencing an epileptic seizure from too many cells firing at the same time. Consider that our brain, a well-functioning complex system, is not “globalized,” or, at least, not naïvely “globalized.”
  
  > The same idea applies to debt—it makes you fragile, very fragile under perturbations, particularly when we switch from the assumption of Mediocristan to that of Extremistan. We currently learn in business schools to engage in borrowing (by the same professors who teach the Gaussian bell curve, that Great Intellectual Fraud, among other pseudosciences), against all historical traditions, when all Mediterranean cultures developed through time a dogma against debt. Felix qui nihil debet goes the Roman proverb: “Happy is he who owes nothing.” Grandmothers who survived the Great Depression would have advised the exact opposite of debt: redundancy; they would urge us to have several years of income in cash before taking any personal risk— exactly my barbell idea of Chapter 11, in which one keeps high cash reserves while taking more aggressive risks but with a small portion of the portfolio. Had banks done that, there would have been no bank crises in history.
