Title: On The Diagonal: Context-Centric Politics
Category: philosophy/politics


Taxes are bad. Taxes are good. Guns are bad. Guns are good. Which side are you on? With a touch of nuance, context, and empathy, one may not actually be forced to decide, despite the ever growing chasm between the echo chambers of each side of the traditional (add: linear, one-dimensional, dogmatic, single-minded, reductionist, and otherwise generally lame) political spectrum. 

The truth is, I have no problem with paying taxes. However, I do have a problem with funneling earned income into the untraceable, game-able, ugly abyss of bureaucracy. Game-ability of big government swings both ways. 

I doubt anyone, wherever they stand politically, delights at the feeling of sending the fruits of their labor to some distant city, flush with corporate dollars and foreign interest groups, in order to serve the interests of Americans. 

Small organizations can stay leaner, and more keen on the environments in which they live, remaining closer in touch, all of geographically, relationally, and thus can solve problems much more efficiently. There's no replacement for feet on the ground. Because they don't possess an accumulation of power and influence, they aren't targeted as viciously by outside influences, because the return on (political capital) investment doesn't exist at that scale. 

A special cases of this small government and state's rights, unique to American political discussion, and perhaps highly influential of the early success after its foundation. They relate to the higher order and more abstract principles of self-representation, self-rule, and self-determination. 

Fortunately, as of writing, this ideology is gaining ground, albeit under a different guise. Democratic presidential candidate Andrew Yang has campaigned on a proposed basic income of one-thousand dollars per month for each American, no questions asked. Of course this appeals to voters wanting a welfare state, but his reasons are slightly more sophisticated than simply wanting to win an election on promises of giving everyone free things. The real reason is steeped in principles of libertarianism like decentralization, the bottom-up approach: that citizens can spend money _better_ (more efficiently, more strategically, and in a way more like to solve hardship and inequality problems) than comfortable bureaucrats in some far away government office complex can. In fact, his campaign had a contest going for follower to tell him how they could. What's more, not only would the dollars be spend more efficiently, but there would be more of them at the ready: bureaucracy and the gunnels of money flow drain an ridiculous amount of net tax revenue before it even gets to the point of flowing out to the people.
