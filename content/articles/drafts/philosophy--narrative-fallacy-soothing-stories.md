Title: Beware the Soothing Story Category: philosophy Status: published

_Related: confirmation bias, epilogism, narrative discipline, narrative fallacy, retrospective distortion, scorn of the abstract_

Storytelling, as human pastime, intends to braid chronological events or related facts into a sequence comprehensible and understandable. With the advantage of hindsight, we imbue a sense of purpose and meaning to events, even though they had no such perceivable meaning at the time. This
storytelling offers us a fabricated sense of control, and deceitful grasp of reality.

## "History-making in hindsight"

History is often the target of bending perception to build up a narrative case, whether it is to understand the world (believing there is more too it than randomness and chaos) for purposes of psychological sanity, or to win political appraise.

> Narrativity can viciously affect the remembrance of past events as follows: we will tend to more easily remember those facts from our past that fit a narrative, while we tend to neglect others that do not appear to play a causal role in the narrative... this simple inability to remember not the true sequence of events but a reconstructed one will make 
history appear in hindsight to be far more explainable that it actually was - or is...

If we come down from our hill of hindsight, an honest appraisal of historical events from _their point in time_, shows us the reality of the situation: what seems obvious in hindsight was not obvious to even the keenest, most anticipatory observers and players. Hindsight offers an arrogant perch
from which we judge our ancestors for sleeping on duty or missing what appears to us, right in front of their eyes.

> History is opaque. You see what comes out, not the script that produces events, the generator of history. There is a fundamental incompleteness in your grasp of such events, since you do not see what's inside the box, how the mechanisms work. What I call the generator of historical events is
> different from the events themselves, much as the minds of the gods cannot be read just by witnessing their deeds. You are very likely to be fooled by their intentions.

Take a personal example of my "normie" educational experience from public school textbooks, and subsequent re-education, on the workings of history. In grade school, history is always refined down into a sequence of events, a series of logical explanations in which one event leads to the next. This
applies to the presentation of the buildup to the second world war, its proceeding, and end. All of the matters a presented on a very coherent timeline, which makes some level of logical sense even to the layman.

I recently read _In the Garden of Beasts_ by Erik Larson, an historical novel documenting the experiences of American diplomats and their families in Berlin as Hitler lead Germany into WWII. The book elucidates the differences between present-sight and hindsight: even the most intelligent,
perceptive, and observant analysts, journalist, and politicians didn't expect.


> We like stories, like to summarize, and we like to simplify, i.e. to reduce the dimensions of matters... The fallacy is associated with our vulnerability to over-interpretation and our predilection for compact stories over raw truths. It severely distorts our mental representation of the world.

## It's in Our Blood

Stories have been an integral part of the human journey, from the time our evolutionary ancestors began drawing on cave walls and sharing lore and folk legends around the first controlled fires. Every civilization offered explanations to life and it's meaning in one way our another, to make 
sense of the world around us, and _us_ ourselves.

> A novel, a story, a myth, or a tale, all have the same function: they spare us from the complexity of the world and shield us from its randomness. Myths impart order to the disorder of human perception and the perceived "chaos of human experience."

Although such culture may not be rationally accepte~d by the thinking parts of human psyche, nonetheless serve to comfort us in our existence, and the fragility, lawlessness of it.

Storytelling is a manifestation of mental comfort seeking, not unlike the concept of comfort eating. It is laziness and undisciplined indulgence of our primal instincts of (mental) satisfaction.

> A higher concentration of dopamine appears to lower skepticism and result in greater vulnerability to pattern detection... [it] seems to increase such activity and lowers one's suspension of belief. The person becomes vulnerable to all manner of fads...

Even our psycho-chemical systems incentivize us to narrate.

## Out of Memory Error

The same mechanisms implemented in modern digital data compression and storage apply to the workings of our brains.

> There is another, even deeper reason for our inclination to narrate, and it is not psychological [or biological]. It has to do with the effect of order on information storage and retrieval in any system, and it's worth explaining here because of what I consider the central problems of probability and information theory... information is costly to manipulate and retrieve... compression [of information] is vital to the performance of conscious work... a pattern is obviously more compact than raw information.

> We, members of the human variety of primates, have a hunger for rules because we need to reduce the dimensions of matters so they can get into our heads... the same condition that makes us simplify pushes us to think that the world is less random than it actually is... forcing a logical link, 
> an arrow of relationship, upon [sequences of facts]... Explanations bind facts together. They make them all the more easily remembered; they help them make more > sense. Where this propensity can go wrong is when it increases our impression of understanding...
>
> Both the artistic and scientific enterprises are the product of our need to reduce dimensions and inflict some order on things. Think of the world around you, laden with trillions of details. Try to describe it and you will find yourself tempted to weave a thread into what you are saying.

In reality, memory is dynamic - not static - like a paper on which new texts (or new versions of the same text) will be continuously recorded, thanks to the power of posterior information... Memory is more of a self-serving dynamic revision machine: you remember the last time you remembered the
event, and, without realizing it, change the story at every subsequent remembrance... revising them involuntarily and unconsciously. We continuously renarrate past events in the light of what appears to make what we think of as logical sense after these events occur... While we believe that memory
is fixed, constant, and connected, all this is very far from the truth. What makes sense according to information obtained subsequently will be remembered more vividly.

The narrative fallacy explains the concept: the same sets of facts, through storytelling and how they are logically linked, can lead to divergent conclusions on the consequences or meaning of the data.

> Beyond our perceptional distortions, there is a problem with logic itself...Consider that two people can hold incompatible beliefs based on the exact same data... the logician W.V. Quine showed that there exist families of logically consistent interpretations and theories that can match a given series of facts... mere absence of nonsense may not be sufficient to make something true.

> We harbor a crippling dislike for the abstract [unknown]... Whenever there is a market move, the news media feel obligated to give the "reason"... It happens all the time: a cause is proposed to make you swallow the news and make matters more concrete... the problem of overcausation does not lie with the journalist, but with the public.... We want to be told stories, and there is nothing wrong with that - except that we should check more thoroughly whether the story provides consequential distortions of reality.

## Onward

We must be willing to accept the disarray of our reality and reallocate our hope, away from stories that console us, and into deeper, spiritual levels of serenity.While we may or may not be aware of the consequences of it, we do it.
