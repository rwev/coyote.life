What Education Can't Teach
The Blind Spots of Education



> You could call this selfhood many things. Transformation. Metamorphosis. Falsity. Betrayal. 
> I call it an education.

> Everything I had worked for, all my years of stufy, had been to purchase muself this one privelege: to see and experience more truths than those given to me by my father, and to use those truths to construct my own mind. I had come to believe that the ability to evaluate many ideas, many histories, many points of view, was at the heart of what it means to self-create. If I yielded now, I would lose more than an argument. I would lose custody of my own mind.

# Beyond the Edges of Education

## A Reduction Problem

“There is always a well-known solution to every human problem—neat, plausible, and wrong,” H.L. Mencken

Education reduces the navigation of problems to the known, the measurable, the concrete, and thus the reduced, simplified. We are taught and trained throughout throughout our educational system, 

The system itself was originally devised for the mass production of workers for mass production (on the assembly line), so it should come as no surprised that many come out of the system as mass produced, in the figurative sense: bland, unaware, dependent on authority and the comfort of assumptions that plague academia, and generally unable to navigate the uncertainties, risk, and real life problems that exist outside of the textbook. 

## A Prediction Problem

Life is too informal, too messy, to uncertain for an education to fully prepare one for it. 

This education problem amounts to a prediction problem: what is taught can't possibly be fit to the circumstances of each individual, so everyone gets a one-size-fits-all. 

This sentiment can be reflected by certain educators in the institutional environment (link foster). For example, some write off learning calculus as pointless, cause a very small proportion of practitioners actually use it in their non-academic profession, even engineers or scientists. Foster totally accepted this truth, but insisted on the importance of calculus nonetheless: learning calculus, new mathematics unseen by students prior in their academic tenure, was actually about learning how to learn a fantastic preparation for higher education, where the breadth of curriculum expands by an order of magnitude, and many new-to-you topics are first discovered and delved into. 

Additionally, while a classic western education teaches some timeless concepts, history, and art,

## No end, no due date, no done date

Transitioning from academia to the real world, this was one of the waking-ups I experienced. In high school and higher education alike, there are due dates, exam dates, and semester end dates, and after any such event, whatever work the was required to meet that is effectively belongs to the past. Academia offers closure. 

Real life however, does not. The work is never over, there is no light-at-the-end-of-the-tunnel end date, beyond which your concerns no longer exist. The toil is infinite, and the satisfaction of a "done" won't find one.
