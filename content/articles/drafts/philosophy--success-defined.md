Title: Success Redefined
Category: philosophy
Tags: success,happiness,contentment

Happiness is determined by how one deals (in processing and perspective) with circumstances, not by them. Our market-driven economic and culture driven by material success and excess consumption tells us the opposite: that we will be happy when we achieve a certain level of status, consumption, security. 
  
We are handed the metrics of success by the Western culture

- fame 
- wealth
- power
- influence
- image

Meaning, importance, and eternal influence and glorification is created by nothing other than _love_. The positive influence we make on an eternal scale, playing in the domain of souls, not bodies. 

It's obvious, that with success being handed down by culture, we need a new culture.
