Title: Level I First Aid Kit 
Category: gear
Tags: preparedness,outdoors

After doing some scenario analysis on what it would be like enter a emergency situation, I decided that the pre-assembled first aid kit was both inadequate for any sort of major emergency, and that I also didn't understand what a more capable system would look like or how to use them.

Upon examination of the pre-packed first aid kits (probably the first time I bothered looking into it) it was plainly obvious that the kit had no ability to treat a major and urgent wound. It was all worthless  in that situation; Only could treat the noncritical: minor scrapes or stings or indigestion with its assortments of band-aids - the exact stuff that _can_ and probably is safe to leave untreated. It was basically a comfort kit. 

So, in order to find a kit that would both treat what _needs_ treated in a versatile, minimal, lightweight unit, ready for the unknown, first major, then minor. Also to understand the application of each of the contents.    

Before I describe the contents of my Level I Kit, let me first outline its philosophy / use case, and the underlying assumptions.   

## Focus on Large, Urgent, Critical Wounds

This kit is not suited for ongoing treatment of recurring symptoms, or small wounds whose treatment could be considered comfort. This kit assumes that the number one approach to any serious medical condition is to _evacuate_. Wounds that could innocently be left untreated, or those which time would heal are not the focus. 

Instead this kit focuses on _urgent_ treatment needs: large wounds involving high blood loss, or those which deep and open enough to present high risk of infection. 

## In Service of Others

This kit is available for the service of other: either in me providing medical provisions, or someone else treating me with my own kit. 

That said, it does not include any items, such as a tourniquet, chest seal, or high-compression bandages that require proper professional training. I wouldn't want someone to treat me with something they don't know how to use, and I don't want to be held liable for giving improper medical treatment to someone else and causing increased injury to them. 

## Standalone

Everything in the kit requires no external / auxiliary equipment to administer. There are no other pieces to the puzzle. Its ready to go: just open and apply.  

Each of these principals are responsible for both the minimal quantity or absence of certain common first aid items.  

# Contents
No ultimatum is made to by brand, although preference was giving in my kit to generic-branded, USA-made materials for maximization of value.
