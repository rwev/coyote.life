The yield of many mornings, afternoons, and evenings spent on the water or in the woods, in all sorts of weather, chasing the various creatures of the earth.
 
# Fishing
These aphorisms connect the seeming triviality of fishing (fly-fishing in particular, or "standing in the water waving a stick") with deeper life lessons.

1. *You can't catch catch a fish without your line in the water.*.

You miss 100% of the fish you don't put your fly in front of and 100% of the casts you don't make. a new take of Michael Jordan's famous line. Now put it out there - it doesn't have to be perfect presentation or the perfect time or the perfect pattern. 

2. *The man in the water catches the fish.*

Fishing's version of Teddy Roosevelt's _Man in the Arena_ essay. The fisherman in the water and close to the action is more likely to catch a fish, even if he sometimes gets in over his waders.

3. *There is no substitute for time spent on the water.*

All the books, advice, and theory in the world will never be as valuable as the wisdom and hard-learned lessons gained from spending time on the water as a practitioner.
