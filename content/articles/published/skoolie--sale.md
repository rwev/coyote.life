In buying the bus, we had been inspired by the idea of an independent, counter-cultural life, in which we'd weed out the delicacy of a specialized career and dependence on debt, and instead favor the freedom, self-sufficiency, robustness, and resiliency of self enterprise.

But last week we sold our Delma. Alas, we decided that we would prefer to be rooted in a strong local community, instead of wandering. 

It has been a fun and rewarding journey transforming Delma into a more livable space. The stress of the project was the best premarital counseling 
one could ask for! We didn't think it would
be easy -- indeed, the act would reject the suburban life of placation and convenience.

We sold Delma to an older, wiser man, a skeptic of our modern envy-based society, who is getting ready to retire. He firmly rejects the materialistic-image lifestyle, and will appreciate Delma as the timeless, indestructible hunk of steel she is, a home forever if cared 
for and maintained. 

Here is the final Craiglist posting that led to Delma's new steward: 

> INTERNATIONAL SCHOOL BUS RV CONVERSION (SKOOLIE)

> 1979 International S1800 Series School Bus with 1982 International-Harvester SU 392 Gasoline V8 Engine.
> 
> cylinders: 8 cylinders
> drive: rwd
> fuel: gas
> odometer: 36834
> paint color: silver
> rv type: class A
> title status: clean
> transmission: automatic
> 
> Fully converted and registered as RV in Idaho.
> 
> - Two 80 gallon fresh water tanks offer a total capacity of 160 gallons, around 4-6 times as much as many other RVs/conversions have. With plenty to spare, water shortages won't constrain your time off-grid. Water is a great luxury: wash your dishes and take showers with freedom.
> 
> - Chassis-mounted ASME propane tanks offer 40 gallon (160 pound) propane capacity and fuel the stove / oven, refrigerator, and water heater appliances for weeks on end. While solar systems are a popular option for conversions, they are sun-dependent, and thus unreliable with changing weather 
   > and seasons. This propane power system runs rain or shine, so park in the shade without the hassle of needing to charge batteries. Propane is clean-burning, inexpensive, and widely available, even in remote places.
> 
> - Dometic RM1303 propane / 120VAC dual power refrigerator / freezer combination unit runs cold, around zero degrees in the freezer on high settings. 8 cubic feet of capacity can hold enough chow for a month away. Run it on propane for off-grid excursions, or plug in to shore power in the city 
   > or at a campground with hookups.
> 
> - Maxxair ceiling vent fan with variable speed, thermostat, air intake and exhaust modes pulls a steady supply of fresh air inside. Parking in the shade and running the fan on exhaust mode keeps the interior temperature comfortable without a noisy and power-hungry air conditioning system.
> 
> - Propane water heater with 6 gallon capacity preheats water for the dual-basin kitchen sink and bathroom shower.
> 
> - Propane lamp above the dinette table offers a rustic warm glow, and adds a bit of warmth for the crisp mornings and evenings in the mountains. With a dedicated propane supply line, there's no need to fuss with the fuel canisters.
> 
> - Magic Chef 4-burner propane stove & oven for plenty of space for multi-dish meals.
> 
> - Atwood propane / carbon monoxide detector in the bedroom for safety while sleeping.
> 
> - Thetford RV flush toilet connects 80 gallon undercarriage-mounted black water tank with standard RV dump valve
> 
> - Serta spring mattress bed, queen-size
> 
> - Exterior storage boxes add additional storage options for outdoor equipment, tools, and other supplies.
> 
> - Window curtains (not pictured)
> 
> - High-efficiency LED interior lighting
> 
> - Auxiliary battery, charged through isolator by alternator
> 
> The engine was recently tuned & timed, including new electrical components (points, distributor cap, spark plug wires, plugs) and a clean original Holley carburetor.
> 
> Brakes are fully performant and ready for the hills, with new brake lines, wheel cylinders, and rear shoes installed this summer.
> 
> All-terrain military-truck tires (installed one month ago) unlock true potential for off-grid exploration of Idaho public lands.
