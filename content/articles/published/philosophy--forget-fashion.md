Title: Forget Fashion, Find Freedom

Just as there are fashions in clothing, music, and other superficial products of the modern economy, there are moral fashions of much larger consequence.

Implicitly exists moral antifashion: there is and has always been throughout time certain opinions of deep consequence that are deemed inappropriate, whether laughable or ridiculous, sternly shameful, or even supposedly earning of violence or other repressive force.

Statements we consider as basic fact today were at some point in time heretical and blasphemous. 

In more cases than not, such revolutionary (in hindsight, i.e. looking from our time, not theirs) claims were made by, what we would consider today, nerds, or more broadly, the outsiders, those who are ridiculed and judged for standing outside of the status quo or the set of generally accepted beliefs. 

Such outsiders dress unfashionably and have good ideas. Convention has less hold over them. Innovators of the past had to fight against popular opinion to reveal scientific truths; we have to do the same today. 

Unfortunately, in our modern era, just like _every other era in history,_ we like to think that we are not vulnerable to such ignorance and blinded by our own fashions. Similarly, what is now unpopular or unthinkable or otherwise "unfashionable" may be the accepted truth tomorrow. In general, it is arrogant to assume that were remain superior to all societies of history, and are excluded from such error. 

> If you could travel back in a time machine, one thing would be true no matter where you went: you’d have to watch what you said... It would be a remarkable coincidence if ours were the first era to get everything just right... People in past times were much like us... Whatever their ideas were, they were ideas reasonable people could believe.

Accepting this reality is one thing; navigating it with principle another. In some contexts, conformism, group-think, or herd mentality is innocuous, such as in the typical context of clothing or other material style. But in other spaces, the consequences are more serious. 

> Fashion is mistaken for good design; moral fashion is mistaken for good... [Violating clothing fashions] gets you laughed at. Violating moral fashions can get you fired, ostracized, imprisoned, or even killed.

How can we safeguard independent thought and living against the tyranny of the often irrational and insecure masses of conformists? First, the dangerous types of fashion must be identified.

## The Conformist Test

> Do you have any opinions that you would be reluctant to express in front of a group of your peers?<br><br>[If not], odds are you just think whatever you’re told. [It is much less likely that] you independently considered every question and came up with the exact same answers that are now considered acceptable.

If you have unpopular opinions, congratulations. You're likely independent and willing to recognize, however unpopular it is to do so, that the popular moral environment contains errors.

Because the moral map favored in societal consensus contains mistakes, just like any other era of history, any individual making the exact same mistakes out of happenstance isn't convincing: just like a copied geographical map will contain the same intentional mistakes that were planted there by the original cartographer.

## The Trouble Test

Another way we can identify fashions is to look at what someone can do to get laughed at or even ostracized. _What we can't say_ is a often a product of the moral map society is following at the time.

> Keep track of opinions that get people in trouble, and start asking, could this be true? Ok, it may be heretical (or whatever modern equivalent), but might it also be true?

Obviously true or obviously false statements or ideas don't get people in trouble. Statements on the edge do: statements that set questioning into movement. They are not obviously true or false, but rather require further consideration.

## The Heresy Test

For this test of fashion following, look for the _application of labels_ as a method of dismissal for provocative thought.

> In every period of history, there seem to have been labels that got applied to statements to shoot them down before anyone had a chance to ask if they were true or not.<br><br>In any period, it should be easy to figure out what such labels are, simply by looking at what people call ideas they disagree with besides untrue.<br><br>When a politician says his opponent is mistaken, that’s a straightforward criticism, but when he attacks a statement a “divisive” or “racially insensitive” instead of arguing that it’s false, we should start paying attention.<br><br>If a statement is [truly] false, that’s the worst thing you can say about it. You don’t need to say that it’s heretical (i.e. label-and-dismiss it)

Labels indicate where society finds emotional and intellectual security. They are telltale signs of which sections of the current moral map may be vulnerable to a rewrite. But when you here labels being apply to statements, _ask why_.

## The Time & Space Test

We can look at the changes in society's moral map over time to identify beliefs that can be potential suspects.

I say _suspects_ because of the potential for false positives. In total, society has gotten closer to an objectively improved moral map. Slavery, for example, was once normalized, and is now considered abhorrent. But many other changes in popular belief are not as cut-and-dry.

Science is the clearest. The field is always driven closer and closer to the truths of the universe, with no real fluctuation.

> Another way to figure out what we’re getting wrong is to look at what used to be acceptable and is now unthinkable.<br><br>In a field like physics, if we disagree with past generations it’s because we’re right and they’re wrong... [but] many changes are just fashion. The age of consent fluctuates like hemlines.

Morality fluctuates (up and down): society cannot possibly always be improving. All societies in the past held views which were wrong; some more than others. Perhaps on the whole, out moral judgment is trending positively upward over time. 

Stay independent, and heed the wisdom of the ages, not losing the scale of time.
