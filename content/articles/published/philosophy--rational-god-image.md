Title: Rational, in God's Image

Despite popular viewpoint that faith and rationality are incompatible, man's ability to reason is central to his uniqueness. 

Secularism and popular culture glorify the role of emotions and a life led by them, offering advice to "following one's heart" or "do what one feels." Some claim that one's emotions define them as a unique individual or fully capture the human experience at the apex of earthly consciousness. Emotions and feelings are tied to warmth and fullness, while logic and reason are deemed mechanical and cold. 

But we're not simply a body, governed by instinct or emotions: Man hosts both reason _and_ God's image. This distinction is what makes us _more_ like God, and different from Beasts, not vice versa. We are the only creatures to be made with a soul and the ability to rationalize, which enables us 

- to think on an intellectual, self-aware, contemplative level,
- to deliberate and plan,
- to have foresight and act strategically and prudently,
- to sense cause and effect,
- to abstract and empathize 

<!-- No other creature organism possess rationality on the specimen level. With populations of all organisms, natural selection operates on the genetic pool to produce rational (biological) solutions given the environment, whether in the form of innate instinct, physical appearance or ability, whether on the holistic or cellular level. Genetic pool feels the ebb and flow of cause and effect and adapts, but no specimen is aware of this process.-->

Accordingly, emotions are what we inherit from our animal origins. There are creatures throughout the animal kingdom who feel emotion on an individual level, such as an killer whale or cow who separated from a newborn calf. 

Perhaps when God gave Man "complete authority over the fish of the sea, the birds of the air, the cattle, and over the entire earth, and over everything that creeps and crawls on the earth" (Genesis 1:28), he gave us control over our inner beasts too. 

Rationality allows us to control our emotions and the recklessness of impulse, and to measure and fit our actions into the scheme of our lives and eternity, not just the fleeting moment. It is the characteristic of God that gives us dominance over our animal side. 

Psychological research separates these emotional and rational mechanisms of action:
 
> <strong>System 1</strong>, the experiential one, is effortless, automatic fast, opaque (we do not know that we are using it), parallel-processed, "intuition", and performs quick acts of prowess (popularized in Malcolm Gladwell's book _Blink_)... [it is] highly emotional, it produces shortcuts, called "heuristics and biases", that allow us to function rapidly and effectively... [it is] "fast and frugal" [and] "quick and dirty." <br><br>...<br><br> <strong>System 2</strong> [is] the cogitative, called "thinking", effortful, reasoned, slow, logical, serial, progressive, self-aware (you can follow steps in your own reasoning), [and] tracable [retrospectively adaptable].<br><br>...<br><br> You have to make an effort (System 2) to override your first reaction. Clearly Mother Nature makes you use the fast System 1 to get out of trouble, so that you do no sit down and cogitate whether there is truly a wild animal attacking you or if it is an optical illusion. You run immediately before you become "conscious" of the presence of the tiger.<br><br>...<br><br>Emotions are assumed to be the weapon System 1 uses to direct us and force us to act quickly. It mediates risk avoidance far more effectively than our cognitive system.<br><br>...<br><br>Much of the trouble with human nature resides in our inability to use much of System 2. 

As does the field of neurobiology:

> Neurobiologists make a similar distinction... except that they operate along anatomical lines [instead of psychological and empirical], <em>the cortical part, which we we are supposed to use for thinking, and which distinguishes us from other animals</em>, and the fast-reacting limbic brain, which is the center of emotions, and which we share with other mammals. <p class="annotation">The Black Swan, Nassim Nicholas Taleb</p>

Many empirically-proven flaws in human judgement and decision making arise from an unchecked System 1, and could be corrected by application of our System 2 reasoning faculties. The science is there, and so is the scripture; the discipline of emotion is advice from the wise:

> "The heart is deceitful above all things, and desperately sick; who can understand it?" - <strong>Jeremiah 17:9</strong><br><br>
> "The gullible believe anything they're told; the prudent sift and weigh every word... The wise watch their steps and avoid evil; fools are headstrong and reckless... Foolish dreamers live in a world of illusion; wise realists plant their feet on the ground... A sound mind makes for a robust body, but runaway emotions corrode the bones." - <strong>Proverbs 14</strong>

My friend Alden illustrates healthy roles for logic and emotions in navigating the openendedness of life with an analogy from orienteering: let logic be your map, and emotions your compass. 

Without logic, one doesn't understand the lay of the terrain around them. Regardless of the direction they travel, they are limited to line of sight and incomplete understanding of the proximate. They can't see what lies beyond obstructions or around the next bend or over the next ridge; they overlook passable routes and lead themselves to dead ends. 

However, with a map of rationality, one can navigate with prudence and wisdom, think ahead with awareness of information that transcends their immediate circumstance. Then, map in hand, emotions, gut instinct, and the subconscious, experiential System 1 act as a compass, to aid in resolving decisions under optionality: choosing one promising route over another, when the further use of logic becomes unclear.
