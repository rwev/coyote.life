Title: Beware the Soothing Story 
Category: philosophy/incerto 
Status: published

Storytelling, as human pastime, intends to braid chronological events or related facts into a sequence comprehensible and understandable.

With the advantage of hindsight, we imbue a sense of purpose and meaning to events, even though they had no such perceivable meaning at the time. This storytelling offers us a fabricated sense of control, and vapid grasp of our reality.

## History-Making in Hindsight

History, broadly, is "any succession of events seen with the effect of posteriority," or hindsight. Our perception of history is bent, manipulated, and distorted as we backfit explanations onto chains of past events for the sake of "understanding." It is only natural. We want to find order and reason in our experience and existence. We want to believe we are in control of our futures and fates, and that what we do matters. 

The pieces of data that fit into a narrative or exhibit shallow logical relation are emphasized, while those that don't fit into our preconceptions are forgotten. Confirmation bias, that "one finds what they are looking for", comes into play here: we are often resolved to a narrative before we get all the data, and latch on to data that corroborates our story, and deflect what contradicts it. 

> Narrativity can viciously affect the remembrance of past events as follows: we will tend to more easily remember those facts from our past that fit a narrative, while we tend to neglect others that do not appear to play a causal role in the narrative... this simple inability to remember not the true sequence of events but a reconstructed one will make history appear in hindsight to be far more explainable that it actually was - or is...

If we come down from our hill of hindsight, an honest appraisal of historical events from _their point in time_, shows us the reality of the situation: what seems obvious in hindsight was not obvious to even the keenest, most anticipatory realtime observers. Hindsight offers an arrogant perch 
from which we judge our ancestors for sleeping on duty or missing what appears to us to have been right in front of their eyes. The reality of the present moment is often far more complex.

Take for example the "normie" educational experience from public school textbooks. The full breadth of history is refined and reduced down into a sequence of events, a series of logical explanations in which one event leads to the next, chapter into chapter, paragraph into paragraph. _X_ led to 
_Y_, which led to _Z_, with arrows of cause and effect, on a coherent timeline making logical sense even to any student or reader. 
This was applied, nonexclusively, to the presentation of the buildup to the second world war, its proceeding, and end. WWII, like many historical developments, is held as an obvious and predictable result of the input catalysts.

In reality, things weren't that simple. I recently read _In the Garden of Beasts_ by Erik Larson, a historical non-fiction presenting the experiences of diplomats, politicians, public service-people, and their families living in Berlin as Hitler lead Germany into WWII. Larson deeply examines primary sources: the personal and official correspondence, journals, and diaries, which form an entirely different picture regarding the course of events and their predictability. Even the most intelligent, perceptive, and observant analysts, journalist, and politicians didn't expect WWII to develop and play the way it did. The difference in perception between present-sight and hindsight can be shocking. The book isn't the only account of this, _Berlin Diary: The Journal of a Foreign Correspondent, 1934-1941_ is another source.

When we teach and think about history,

> We like stories, like to summarize, and we like to simplify, i.e. to reduce the dimensions of matters... The fallacy is associated with our vulnerability to over-interpretation and our predilection for compact stories over raw truths. It severely distorts our mental representation of the world.

Much of the mainstream presentation of history is overly reductive and deterministic, and ignores the simple and consequential truths that hindsight is 20/20, and prediction is very difficult in realtime because the world is random and not beholden to us. But to admit so would make the content less interesting, transforming it effectively from a compelling storyline to a set of facts, with the exercise of interpretation left up to the reader.

To avoid biased interpretations of past events, we must remain open to _all_ the facts, not just those which offer cohesion. Further, we should acknowledge that we have limited access to information and thus a hindered ability to understand cause and effect.

## It's in Our Blood

Stories have been an integral part of the human journey, from the time our evolutionary ancestors began drawing on cave walls and sharing lore and folk legends around the first tamed campfires. Every civilization offered explanations to life and it's meaning in one way our another, to make sense of the world around us, and _us_ ourselves.

> A novel, a story, a myth, or a tale, all have the same function: they spare us from the complexity of the world and shield us from its randomness. Myths impart order to the disorder of human perception and the perceived "chaos of human experience."

Although such culture may not be rationally accepted by the thinking parts of human psyche, nonetheless serve to comfort us in our existence, and the fragility, lawlessness of it, and console us with the prospect that there more to our experience than randomness and chaos, that we can control the outcomes.

Storytelling is a manifestation of mental comfort seeking, not unlike the concept of comfort eating. It is laziness and undisciplined indulgence of our primal instincts of (mental) satisfaction.

> A higher concentration of dopamine appears to lower skepticism and result in greater vulnerability to pattern detection... [it] seems to increase such activity and lowers one's suspension of belief. The person becomes vulnerable to all manner of fads...

Our psycho-chemical systems and biological limitations incentivize us to narrate.

The same mechanisms implemented in modern digital data compression and storage apply to the workings of our finite brains. Our tendency to simplify with stories is a problem of "information storage and retrieval" and "central to probability and information theory". Because "information is costly to
manipulate and retrieve", "compression [of information] is vital to the performance of conscious work... a pattern is obviously more compact than raw information."

> We, members of the human variety of primates, have a hunger for rules because we need to reduce the dimensions of matters so they can get into our heads... the same condition that makes us simplify pushes us to think that the world is less random than it actually is... forcing a logical link, 
> an arrow of relationship, upon [sequences of facts]... Explanations bind facts together. They make them all the more easily remembered; they help them make more sense. Where this propensity can go wrong is when it increases our impression of understanding...

## Onward

We must be willing to accept the disarray of our reality and reallocate our hope, away from stories that console us, and into deeper, spiritual levels of _serenity_.
