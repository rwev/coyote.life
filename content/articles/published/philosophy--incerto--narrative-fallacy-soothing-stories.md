Title: Beware the Soothing Story Category: philosophy Status: published
Category: incerto

Storytelling, as human pastime, intends to braid chronological events or related facts into a sequence comprehensible and understandable. 

With the advantage of hindsight, we imbue a sense of purpose and meaning to events, even though they had no such perceivable meaning at the time. This storytelling offers us a fabricated sense of control, and deceitful grasp of reality.

## "History-making in hindsight"

History is often the target of bending perception to build up a narrative to understand the world or to believe there is more too our experience than randomness and chaos, and that we can control the outcomes. The events that we can fit into a convenient explanation are those more often recalled as significant. 

> Narrativity can viciously affect the remembrance of past events as follows: we will tend to more easily remember those facts from our past that fit a narrative, while we tend to neglect others that do not appear to play a causal role in the narrative... this simple inability to remember not the true sequence of events but a reconstructed one will make
history appear in hindsight to be far more explainable that it actually was - or is...

If we come down from our hill of hindsight, an honest appraisal of historical events from _their point in time_, shows us the reality of the situation: what seems obvious in hindsight was not obvious to even the keenest, most anticipatory observers. Hindsight offers an arrogant perch
from which we judge our ancestors for sleeping on duty or missing what appears to us to right in front of their eyes. The reality of the present moment is often far more complex. 

> History is opaque. You see what comes out, not the script that produces events, the generator of history. There is a fundamental incompleteness in your grasp of such events, since you do not see what's inside the box, how the mechanisms work... the minds of the gods cannot be read just by 
> witnessing their deeds. 

Take a personal example of my "normie" educational experience from public school textbooks, and subsequent re-education, on the workings of history. In grade school, history is refined down into a sequence of events, a series of logical explanations in which one event leads to the next, chapter into chapter, paragraph into paragraph. This applied, nonexclusively, to the presentation of the buildup to the second world war, its proceeding, and end. All of the events were a presented on a very coherent timeline, which makes some level of logical sense even to the layman.  WWII was held as an obvious and predictable result of the input catalysts. 

I recently read _In the Garden of Beasts_ by Erik Larson, an historical novel documenting the experiences of American diplomats and their families in Berlin as Hitler lead Germany into WWII. The book elucidates the differences between present-sight and hindsight: even the most intelligent,
perceptive, and observant analysts, journalist, and politicians didn't expect WWII to develop and run its course the way it did. The book isn't the only account of this, _Berlin Diary: The Journal of a Foreign Correspondent, 1934-1941_ is another source.

When we teach and think about history,  

> We like stories, like to summarize, and we like to simplify, i.e. to reduce the dimensions of matters... The fallacy is associated with our vulnerability to over-interpretation and our predilection for compact stories over raw truths. It severely distorts our mental representation of the world.

To avoid biased interpretations of past events, we must remain open to _all_ the facts, not just those which offer cohesion. Further, we should acknowledge that we have limited access to information and thus hindered ability to understand cause and effect.

## It's in Our Blood

Stories have been an integral part of the human journey, from the time our evolutionary ancestors began drawing on cave walls and sharing lore and folk legends around the first controlled fires. Every civilization offered explanations to life and it's meaning in one way our another, to make 
sense of the world around us, and _us_ ourselves.

> A novel, a story, a myth, or a tale, all have the same function: they spare us from the complexity of the world and shield us from its randomness. Myths impart order to the disorder of human perception and the perceived "chaos of human experience."

Although such culture may not be rationally accepted by the thinking parts of human psyche, nonetheless serve to comfort us in our existence, and the fragility, lawlessness of it.

Storytelling is a manifestation of mental comfort seeking, not unlike the concept of comfort eating. It is laziness and undisciplined indulgence of our primal instincts of (mental) satisfaction.

> A higher concentration of dopamine appears to lower skepticism and result in greater vulnerability to pattern detection... [it] seems to increase such activity and lowers one's suspension of belief. The person becomes vulnerable to all manner of fads...

Our psycho-chemical systems and biological limitations incentivize us to narrate.

The same mechanisms implemented in modern digital data compression and storage apply to the workings of our finite brains. Our tendency to simplify with stories is a problem of "information storage and retrieval" and "central to probability and information theory". Because "information is 
costly to 
manipulate and retrieve", "compression [of information] is vital to the performance of conscious work... a pattern is obviously more compact than raw information."

> We, members of the human variety of primates, have a hunger for rules because we need to reduce the dimensions of matters so they can get into our heads... the same condition that makes us simplify pushes us to think that the world is less random than it actually is... forcing a logical link, an arrow of relationship, upon [sequences of facts]... Explanations bind facts together. They make them all the more easily remembered; theyhelp them make more sense. Where this propensity can go wrong is when it increases our impression of understanding...

## Onward

We must be willing to accept the disarray of our reality and reallocate our hope, away from stories that console us, and into deeper, spiritual levels of _serenity_. 

> God, grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change,
courage to change the things I can,
and wisdom to know the difference. <p class="annotation">Reinhold Niebuhr (1892â€“1971)</p>
