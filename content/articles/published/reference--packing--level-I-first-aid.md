After doing some emergency scenario analysis, I decided that the pre-assembled store-bought first aid kit I carried was both inadequate for any sort of major emergency, and that I also didn't understand what a more capable system would look like or how to use them. Ultimately, I built one myself.   

Upon examination of the pre-packed first aid kit, and others like it, it was plainly obvious that such a kit has no ability to treat a major and urgent wound. It was all worthless in a true emergency, and amounted to nothing more than a creature-comfort kit, only able to treat the noncritical, like minor scrapes or stings with its assortments of band-aids - the exact stuff that _can_ and probably is safe to leave untreated. 

So, I set out find a kit that would both treat what _needs_ treated in a versatile, minimal, lightweight unit, ready for the unknown, first major, then minor, and also to understand the practical application of each of the contents.   

# The Philosophy

Before I describe the contents of my Level 1 Kit, let me first outline its philosophy / use case, and the underlying assumptions.   

## Focus on Large, Urgent, Critical Wounds

This kit is _not_ focused on
 
 - ongoing treatment of recurring symptoms, or 
 - small wounds whose treatment could be considered optional and a matter comfort or convenience, or 
 - those which time would safely heal. 

Instead, this kit assumes that the number one approach to any serious medical condition is to _evacuate_, and is focused on _urgent_ treatment needs, such large wounds involving high blood loss or those which deep and open enough to present critical and immediate risk of infection. 

## In Service of Others

This kit is available for the service of other: either in me providing medical provisions, or someone else treating me with my own kit. I wouldn't want someone to treat me with something they don't know how to use, and I don't want to be held liable for giving improper medical treatment to someone else and causing increased injury to them. 

That said, it does not include any advanced items, such as a tourniquet, chest seal, or high-compression bandages that require proper professional training. It is also a level 1 kit: a designated medic with additional training might include those items in a level 2 kit.   

## Standalone

Everything in the kit requires no external / auxiliary equipment to administer. There are no other pieces to the puzzle. Its ready to go: just open and apply.  

Each of these principals are responsible for both the minimal quantity or absence of certain common first aid items.  

## Modularity and Composition

The kit provides "building block" items that can be adapted for a variety of applications, 

For example, the 3M first aid tape(s) can be used in conjunction with the telfa non-adherent dressing to treat wounds from large to small. Leave the full 8" x 3", or trim it down to fit a wound of any smaller or unique size or shape (this is effectively what a band-aid is anyway).

It is versatile and ready for unknown. 


# The Contents

No ultimatum is made  by brand, although preference was given to generic-branded, USA-made materials for maximization of value. 

Not everything is pictured as listed, as the first aid kit is in service and supplies and intermittently depleted as used, or replenished with on-hand supplies of other brands.

Here's the list of contents:

- FAO (first aid only) triple antibiotic ointment, 3-5 0.9g packets
- FAO first aid / burn cream, 3-5 0.9 packets
- FAO 4" x 4" waterjel burn dressing, liquid soaked, 1 unit (optional, may remove to save weight)
- FAO benzalkonium chloride antiseptic towelettes, 2-3
- covidien 3085 kerlix super sponge, medium, 6" x 6 3/4", 1 pouch of 5
- covidien 1238 telfa non-adherent Pads / dressings, prepack, 8" x 3", 3-4 units 
- exactmed nylon monofilament non-absorbant surgical sutures, sterile, 1-2
- amex medical blue nitrile gloves, 4 mil, latex/powder free, 3-5 gloves
- scalpel, havalon piranta replacement blade, 60A carbon stainless, sterile, 1 blade
- 3M nexcare absolute waterproof tape, 1" width, 18-30" (wrapped on plastic card)
- 3M nexcare clear first aid tape, 1" width, 24" - 40" (wrapped on plastic card)
- quik-clot combat gauze, traumatic bleeding hemostatic dressing, vacuum-packed z-folded, 3" x 4 yd 
- physician's care individually wrapped tablets: aspirin, non-aspirin (acetaminophen), ibuprofen, antacid (3-4 each)
- chlor-floc water treatment tablets (2-4)

Edits, added since original post:

- waterproof adhesive transparent dressing / bandage 
- 3M steri-strip reinforced skin closures - 1/2" x 4" x 6 strip envelope

Everything is packed in a deliberate order, offering both the obvious appearance as a first aid kit and also transparency into its contents. 

Also note that the supplies critical to control the most urgent wounds, i.e. the sponges and quik-clot, are nearest to the zip-lock opening for optimal accessibility under duress.  

The containment bag is thick, tough mylar - a military surplus "document envelope", national stock number (NSN) 8105-00-334-4120. 

All in, the kit weighs in at 9.4 oz, as pictured, and without the optional waterjel burn dressing, closer to 6.5 oz. 

I keep this IFAK level 1 kit in every vehicle, in my outdoor gear for packing on outings and excursions, in each every-day carry (EDC) loadout, and in my construction / projects tool box. 


## Level 0

Although the complete Level 1 kit listed above is quite lightweight, it is ill-suited to integration into compact EDC systems due to its bulk. 

The Level 0 kit is a trimmer variant of the Level 1 kit, containing a subset of items, while preserving much of the capability in a denser package. 

In particular, the Level 0 excludes the notably voluminous covidien kerlix sponges, and reduces item redundancy across the board.
