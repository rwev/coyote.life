Carrying a loaded [Helikon-Tex "Bandicoot"](https://www.helikon-tex.us/bandicoot-waist-pack-cordura.html) waist pack for a reasonable level of preparedness in a discreet package.

# Philosophy 

This loadout is tailored for sub-/urban (on-grid) defense of life; thus, it excludes some heavier duty tools and gear better suited for the backcountry.

Crafted with the goal of being *self-contained & stand-alone*, this system does not require that the components be broken up and distributed between belt, cargo pockets, or other containers. Instead, it is grab-and-go, offering greater situational versatility and lower mental overhead. 

No dress code is required of the user: the system is not dependent on a belt, a baggy shirt, deep pockets, and so on. This is in great contrast to many of the systems out there. 

Additionally, the components as well and the pack itself were chosen to be as compact and lightweight as possible. Although this certainly limits capability, the system is nimble enough to carry on a daily basis without much inconvenience. 


# Contents

In the main compartment:

- ruger LCP .380, cerakoted, 6+1 rounds, w/ extra magazine, in a desantis pocket holster, suspended in positive draw position with ziptie through inner loop attachment
- <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">havalon piranta replacable blade knife w/ extras</span> gerber 600 USA-made folding knife 
- wescott titanium sewing scissors, 2.5"
- folomov 18650S 3.9", 50g, 900 lumen, USB rechargeable flashlight w/ extra battery
- niteize flashlight headband
- scripto lighter
- leatherman micra

Because of the visibility of the weapon, I avoid putting items that are used daily or otherwise regularly accessed  in the main compartment. Instead, I keep miscellaneous items in the outer pocket, such as:

- notepad & pen
- cell phone / wallet / keys
- zipties & ziplocks
- plastic eating utensils (flexible and lightweight, USA made, originally from Chipotle)
- hand sanitizer gel pen
- ear plugs

In inner facing belt compartment, I keep a level 0 IFAK (a reduced, lean version of the [level 1](/level-1-first-aid-kit.html)). This is kept isolated for quick and deliberate accessibility in the face of emergency: there is no interference with other components to fumble with. 

Edits: 
- replaced the sharp, delicate, limited use havalon piranta with the full-sized gerber 600 for improved utility and versatility choice
