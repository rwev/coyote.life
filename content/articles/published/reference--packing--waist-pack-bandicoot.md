Carrying a compact [Helikon-Tex "Bandicoot"](https://www.helikon-tex.us/bandicoot-waist-pack-cordura.html) waist pack for dynamic preparedness in a city environment.

# Philosophy 

Crafted with the goal of being *self-contained & stand-alone*, this system is  *grab-and-go* and offers greater situational versatility and lower mental overhead than other every-day-carry (EDC) systems, many of which are dependent on the  distribution (scatter) of items among d:ifferent areas of the body, clothing items, or accessories.

Because waist pack carry functions independently of a belt, a baggy shirt, or deep pockets, this system is modular and integrated independently of the outfit. No dress code, pre-planning, or continuous transfer (and subsequent loss & disorganization) of items between disparate containers is required of the user. Modularity reduces complication and moving parts, and thus  increases the likelihood that components are where you expect them in a critical moment. 

At same time the slim profile of the waist pack stands to benefit from said "traditional" on-body concealment techniques: a long shirt tail is not a requirement, but an advantage. 

The contents and the pack itself were chosen to be as compact and lightweight as possible. Although this certainly limits capability, the system is nimble & discreet enough to carry on a daily basis without much inconvenience. 

This loadout is tailored for sub-/urban (on-grid) preparation & defense of life; it excludes some heavier duty gear better suited for the more extreme, off-grid environments.

# Contents

This list is not static but is meant to give a general idea of the system components. The system undergoes constant trials and adaptation to new environments and requirements. 

In the main compartment:

- ruger LCP .380, burnt bronze custom cerakoted, 6+1 rounds, w/ extra magazine, in a desantis pocket holster, suspended in positive draw position with ziptie through inner loop attachment, tensioned with rubber band
- <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">havalon piranta replacable blade knife w/ extras</span> gerber 600 USA-made folding knife 
- <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">wescott titanium sewing scissors, 2.5"</span>
- folomov 18650S 3.9", ultralight (50g), 900 lumen, USB rechargeable flashlight w/ extra 18650 battery
- niteize flashlight headband (holds folomov)
- scripto lighter
- leatherman micra multitool

Because of the visibility of the weapon, I avoid putting items that are used daily or otherwise regularly accessed  in the main compartment. Instead, I keep miscellaneous routine items in the outermost pocket, such as:

- notepad & pen
- cell phone / wallet / keys
- zipties, ziplock bags, flat-folded duct tape
- plastic eating utensils (flexible and lightweight, USA made, originally from Chipotle)
- hand sanitizer gel pen
- reflective signaling panel
- ear plugs

In inner facing belt compartment, I keep a level 0 IFAK (a reduced, lean version of the [level 1](/level-1-first-aid-kit.html)). This is kept isolated for quick and deliberate accessibility in the face of emergency: there is no interference with other components to fumble with. 

## Modifications

Like any system in service, the waist pack undergoes continuous trial and error and iterative revision. 
  
The following edits have been made since the
 original posting:

- replaced the sharp, delicate, limited use havalon piranta with the full-sized gerber 600 (improved utility and versatility)
- deleted the titanium sewing scissors in favor of the built-in scissors of leatherman micra (removed non-critical redundancy)
