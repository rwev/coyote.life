Carrying a loaded [Helikon-Tex "Bandicoot"](https://www.helikon-tex.us/bandicoot-waist-pack-cordura.html) waist pack for a reasonable level of preparedness & capability in a discreet package.

# Philosophy 

This loadout is tailored for (sub-)urban, on-grid defense of life, and thus excludes some heavier duty tools and outdoor gear.

Crafted with the goal of being *self-contained & stand-alone*, this system does not require that the components be broken up and distributed between belt, cargo pockets, or other containers. Instead, it is grab-and-go, offering greater situational versatility and lower mental overhead. No dress code is required of the user: the system is not dependent on a belt, a baggy shirt, deep pockets, and so on. This is in great contrast to many of the systems out there. 

# Contents

In the main compartment:

- ruger LCP .380, cerakoted, 6+1 rounds, w/ extra magazine
- havalon piranta knife, w/ extra replaceable blades
- wescott titanium sewing scissors, 2.5"
- folomov 18650S 3.9", 50g, 900 lumen, USB rechargeable flashlight w/ extra battery
- niteize flashlight headband
- scripto lighter
- leatherman micra

Because of the visibility of the weapon, I avoid putting items that are used daily or otherwise regularly accessed  in the main compartment. Instead, I keep such miscellaneous items like notepad & pen, cell phone, wallet, etc. in the outer pocket.

In inner facing belt compartment, I keep a level 0 IFAK (a reduced, lean version of the [level 0](/level-1-first-aid-kit.html)). This is kept isolated for quick and deliberate accessibility in the face of emergency: there is no interference with other components to fumble with.
