Title: The View of a Finite Mortal, Problems Evident

We are not God; we exist in incomplete presence and conscience.

> History is opaque. You see what comes out, not the script that produces events, the generator of history. There is a fundamental incompleteness in your grasp of such events, since you do not see what's inside the box, how the mechanisms work... the minds of the gods cannot be read just by witnessing their deeds.

We have no way to ascertain the ultimate, universal truth. We must _induce_ truth from the evidence of our experience.

However, it is impossible to glean _certain truth_ from _partial experience_. We observe a reduction, from which is it impossible to deterministically map back onto reality. We cannot "figure out properties of the infinite unknown based on the finite known."

This is the fundamental nature of induction:

> Inductive reasoning is distinct from deductive reasoning. While, if the premises are correct, the conclusion of a deductive argument is _certain_, the truth of the conclusion of an inductive argument is _probable_, based upon the evidence given.

We have partial perspective, both over time and space, and therefore we are required to make assumptions of our data, our experience, our evidence. Much of what we "know" is actually just varying degrees of "probable."

With assumptions (along with [stories](https://coyote.life/beware-the-soothing-story.html), we conform an uncertain world onto structures or frameworks of analysis that make sense to us. Assumptions aid in the reconciliation between what we see and what we suppose to be the larger truth.  The broadest assumption of all: that data is valuable. Is it?

## Data is Old

Empirical data is intrinsically historical. We observe or measure some characteristic, and record it.

[Data science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_science) is therefore the study (of a glimpse) of the past to in order to predict or generalize. It is induction, harnessing what we see to figure out what we don't see, which assumes that a  mapping holds, and:

1. that the data we have is indeed a representative sample;
2. that the underlying distribution (probability function) doesn't change over time.

Data science "learning by experience." What if what we have experienced isn't everything we will experience?

If we are to prepare for the future, we have to uncouple our thinking from our experience. Experience is useful, but there are fundamental limitations of its ability to fully encapsulate and reflect the forward-looking truth.

## Data is Toxic

In the "big data" phase of the information age, we can collect and study exponentially more data than at any point in human history. With more evidence, "statistical significance" increases, and we feel more confident in our ability to understand the past and predict the future.

> The more information you give someone, the more hypotheses they will formulate along the way, and the worse off they will be. They see more random noise and mistake it for information.... once we produce a theory, we are not likely to change our minds -- so those who delay developing theories are better off.

The cognitive bias of [anchoring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anchoring_(cognitive_bias)) causes us to rely too heavily on initial information as a point of reference before making subsequent judgments & decisions, even in light of later, contradictory information.

But what if more data just means more noise? What pulling more data into a faulty framework just makes us more wrong?

### Data Kills the Turkey

Not only may data itself be useless, it may be harmful. Let the plumping and subsequent butchering of a turkey serve as a metaphor:

>  Consider a turkey that is fed every day. Every single feeding will firm up the bird's belief that it is the general rule of life to be fed every day by friendly members of the human race "looking out for its best interests" as a politician would say... this problem can be generalized to any situation where the same hand that feeds you can be the one that wrings your neck.
>
> Consider that the turkey's experience may have, rather than no value, a negative value... Its confidence increased the number of friendly feedings grew, and it felt increasingly safe even though the slaughter was more and more imminent... the feeling of safety reached its maximum when the risk was at the highest!

More of the same unevenly sampled data may not get us closer to the truth, but instead result in incorrect conclusions, and with each additional data point, become more sure of that faulty conclusion.

### Negative Empiricism

All data isn't equal. Certain data points are more valuable than others, in the sense that they are more influential to our analysis.

> A series of corroborative facts is not necessarily evidence. Seeing white swans does not confirm the existence of black swans [it only reinforces the belief that all swans are white].
>
> We can get closer to the truth by _negative_ instances, not by verification. It is misleading to build a general rule from observed facts. Contrary to conventional wisdom, our body of knowledge does not increase from a series of confirmatory observations, like the turkey's.
>
> This asymmetry is immensely practical... Sometimes a lot of data can be meaningless; at other times one single piece of information can be very meaningful... _you know what is wrong with a lot more confidence that you know what is right_.

As the traditional aphorism goes, "absence of evidence is not evidence of absence."

More of the same, or in the turkey's case, another day of feeding, is an additional _confirmatory_, corroborative data point, and essentially useless.

One _disconfirmatory_ data point can nullify a theory formed from millions of confirmatory data points.  

We care about the outliers. The data _outside_ the scope of our current information set have the most potential to effect a sweeping rework of our understanding.

## Action Items

So here we are, finite mortals, constrained in ability to comprehend the full, true nature of our reality. How can we navigate these circumstances and make better decisions, and come to truer, if less certain, conclusions?

To avoid the fate of the turkey and death by data:

- Proceed with a curious, open mind, and a keen awareness of our limited perspective in time and space;
- Keep an anti-library: focus on the _unread books_ and more generally _what you don't know_. Don't fixate on your knowledge and experience.
- Recognize that the "very nature of randomness lies in its abstraction: the unknown unknowns."
- Restrict flow of the modern data fire hose: consume confirmed and delayed information, not the sensationalized, push-notification type.
