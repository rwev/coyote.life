Title: Of Schools and Prisons
Category: philosophy/education

Both hold subjects on premises, keep subjects alive and non-violent, distance the leaders and subjects, form social structure independent of the supervision, which tend to be barbaric in nature, and make an effort to instill teaching, whether moral or educational.

Although this connection is undoubtedly extreme, the points are fathomable. Perhaps a more realistic, less gruesome analogy would be that schools, particular high schools, proliferate fake, bubbled-in societies, with a values system very different than that of society at large. 

> The primary purpose [of schools] is to keep kids locked up in one place for a big chunk of the day so adults can get things done... in a specialized industrial society, it would be a disaster to have kids running around loose.<br><br>What bothers me is [that] the kids aren’t told about [being kept in prisons], and [that] the prisons are run mostly by the inmates. Kids are sent off to spend six years memorizing meaningless facts in a world ruled by a caste of giants who run after an oblong brown ball, as if this were the most natural thing in the world. And if they balk at this surreal cocktail, they’re called misfits.

It's hard for kids to realize that the high school society isn't real, because they've never known differently. If a kid doesn't fit in the messed-up social structure, the next logical step they take is that they don't fit in the world or that something is wrong with them instead of the degenerate kid world.

How did we get here?

Since the dawn of civilization, adults have worked while kids grow, help, and learn. What changed? 

The world as a whole has became more complicated & specialized. Our educational system (d-)evolved as it entered the age of urbanization, globalization, emphasizing higher education over the trades. 

> Teenage kids used to have a more active role in society. In pre-industrial times, they were all apprentices of one sort or another, whether in shops or on farms or even on warships. They weren’t left to create their own societies. They were junior members of adult societies.<br><br>Teenage apprentices in the Renaissance were working dogs. Teenagers now are neurotic lapdogs. Their craziness is the craziness of the idle everywhere... Now adults have no immediate [productive] use for teenagers.<br><br>Teenagers seem to have respected adults more then, because the adults were the visible experts in the skills they were trying to learn. Now most kids have little idea what their parents do in their distant offices, and see no connection between schoolwork and the work they’ll do as adults.

Kids joined the real-world workforce as early as 12 in pre-industrial times. Now, most don't until age 18 or 22. Kids of centuries before worked and learned alongside adults. They were forced to engage in the real world, and what they learned, they _learned from the real world_. They were also forced to recognize the wisdom and expertise of adults.

Regardless of the rosy historical hindsight, the heavy reality of our modern economic and education system remains. A practical question is this: how do you get kids who feel unpopular to realize that the real world in bigger and better than anything they've ever known outside of textbooks?

Maybe the answer of this is more exposure during the schooling experience to the real world: preventing the bubble from forming in the first place. Showing, not just telling, how the arts and sciences are relevant to their future success and aspirations in the world at large. Reality-check the high school system. Reward the nerds by continually expanding the system of incentives and recognition beyond athletics. Keep achievement relative to the scale of life, not the small-town adolescent popularity contest.

Nerds are the natural skeptics of the situation. If being a misfit in their temporary juvenile holding center means lifelong success, let it be. Be the misfit, be the nerd, not losing sight of the long and winding path beyond.
