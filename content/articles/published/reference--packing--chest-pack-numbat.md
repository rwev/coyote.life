A loaded [Helikon-Tex "Numbat"](https://www.helikon-tex.us/chest-pack-numbat.html) chest pack for the backcountry.

The philosophy of the chest pack system is similar to that of the [waist pack](/waist-pack-for-sub-urban-edc.html), designed for modularity and context-independence.

However, the  Numbat's unconventional mount location, the chest, merits its own discussion. Summarily, placement on the chest limits the peripheral obtrusiveness and friction of the system with the immediate environment, increasing accessibility. 
        
In essentially any bodily position - sitting or lying, riding in or on a vehicle, or crawling under obstacles - the upper chest remains generally protected and accessible, due to its vicinity to the face and eyes and our instinctive desire to protect the brain and visual sense. In emergencies that limit motion, such as becoming trapped or pinned by rock or snow, or experiencing major motor disability, the chest is more reachable than elsewhere lower on the body. 

Contrast this to the hip or leg mounted system, which can easily become blocked even in normal scenarios, like sitting in a car with a seat belt on. Friction with the environment and relative position of the body often make such systems routinely inaccessible, or at least uncomfortable or inconvenient.
