Why should _you_ should drive an old, cheap vehicle, colloquially known as "rust-buckets", "rattle-traps", and "ol 'beaters"?

There is a broad basket of reasons why.

## Money - It's Cheaper

## Reliability - Really? 

### The Bathtub Curve 


## Freedom

The vehicles that are theoretically most suited for backcountry, off-road travel are rarely the ones I see out there.  


The brand new rigs with the tunes, the upgrades, winch, roll-bars, are the ones I also see sitting in driveways and apartment complex parking lots, day after day, weekend after weekend, in mint (unused) condition. 

There are multiple explanations one can offer for this. 

First, new things, and moreso new things with the latest upgrades, are expensive. Repairs are expensive. And the cost of wear, even honest wear, is much higher on new things, as it accelerates the already astronomical cost of depreciation.
