Why should _you_ should drive an old, cheap vehicle, colloquially known as "rust-buckets", "rattle-traps", and "ol 'beaters"?

There is a broad basket of reasons why.

## Money - It's Cheaper

## Reliability - Really? 

### Reliability & The Bathtub Curve 

The common misconception about old cars, and thus a justification for buying a new one is that newer cars are more reliable, while old ones are ticking time bombs. 

Experientially and anecdotally, that has not been the case. I've had more friends buy practically new cars only to have catastrophic mechanical problems only months or even weeks later. The repair costs alone were more the cash purchase price of either of the vehicles. 

How could this be? The [bathtub curve](http://www.catb.org/jargon/html/B/bathtub-curve.html) concept, born in the tech industry which describes the likelihood of failure of a device over time: 

> Common term for the curve (resembling an end-to-end section of one of those claw-footed antique bathtubs) that describes the expected failure rate of electronics with time: initially high, dropping to near 0 for most of the system's lifetime, then rising again as it ‘tires out’. See also burn-in period, infant mortality.

New cars are freshly composed complex systems, with unproven design and components, while old cars are proven systems refined by the trials of use. 

Any bugs in an experienced system have been ironed out and the vehicle has settled into an equilibrium of balanced working order, while the maturity cycle of young system is uncharted and bound to be wrought with unforeseen troubles, whether design concerns or parts failure (as true for life as it is for vehicles).

Old cars are "burned in" and matured into adulthood, while new cars are still prone to the spontaneous and unpredictable sensitivities of infancy. 

## Simplicity

In the case when an older vehicle needs critical maintanance, which may be less often than an infant vehicle, it is significantly likely to cost less, either because the repair procedure isn't as complicated, or it can realistically be self-repaired with amateur knowledge and tools. 

## Freedom

There are two dimensions to freedom here. 

The first in the _material freedom_. 

Old cars, at least the off-road-capable ones that I drive, are generally already well-worn, and have scores of scuffs and scrapes and dents and broken non-essentials (cosmetic elements), called _personality_.



The vehicles that are theoretically most suited for backcountry, off-road travel are rarely the ones I see out there.  

The brand new rigs with the tunes, the upgrades, winch, roll-bars, are the ones I also see sitting in driveways and apartment complex parking lots, day after day, weekend after weekend, in mint (unused) condition. 

There are multiple explanations one can offer for this. 

First, new things, and moreso new things with the latest upgrades, are expensive. Repairs are expensive. And the cost of wear, even honest wear, is much higher on new things, as it accelerates the already astronomical cost of depreciation. 
  
Take the words of this [fellow r/overlanding user](https://www.reddit.com/r/overlanding/comments/ebfqtr/the_most_important_feature_of_a_longterm/). Driving a $500 jeep, he has done more _doing_ than the vast majority of other overlanders, most of which don't _do_ anything except oogle over overlanding rig porn, and pour money into their overbuilt rigs, that sit in their garage, while they go to work to pay for them .

> I've met a ton of people having massive global adventures in POS unreliable vehicles all over the world. From Honduras to Bolivia and Botswana to Kenya there are people driving $500 vehicles having a blast... I've never met anyone having global adventures in a super-expensive super-reliable vehicle, <em>because they never went on the adventure... the most important feature of a long-term expedition vehicle: no payments!</em><p>u/grecy</p>
