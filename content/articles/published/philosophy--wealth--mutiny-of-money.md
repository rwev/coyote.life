Title: The Mutiny of Money

Status: published

Known by collective society for ages, material gain and the power that it brings can distract and destroy.

<!-- > Where your treasure is, there your heart will be also. No one can serve two masters. Either you will hate the one and love the other, or you will be devoted to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve both God and money. <p class="annotation">Matthew 6:20-21, 24</p> -->

Money itself isn't the problem. Money is amoral, a tool that can be used with virtue, or for deviant purposes - a choice delegated to the user. 

> For the love of money is a root of all kinds of evil. Some people, eager for money, have wandered from the faith and pierced themselves with many griefs. Command those who are rich in this present world not to be arrogant nor to put their hope in wealth, which is so uncertain, but to put their hope in God, who richly provides us with everything for our enjoyment. Command them to do good, to be rich in good deeds, and to be generous and willing to share In this way they will lay up treasure for themselves as a firm foundation for the coming age, so that they may take hold of the life that is truly life. <p class="annotation">1 Timothy 6:10, 17-19</p>

First, the money is appreciated, with windfalls being a great blessing. But as increase continues, owners are brought into dependence on the fleeting & earthly: paychecks and portfolios. 

Consider the concept of [diminishing marginal utility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marginal_utility). Wealth, as observed in the third person, actually has not only diminishing marginal return, but that return also eventually becomes _negative_. When possessed in certain excess, money makes them _worse_ off, in a holistic sense: less fulfilled, less centered on the real, eternal treasures of love & community, more greedy, more reliant on it for security, psychological validation, and _answers_.

The trap of accumulation is infinite cycle of dissatisfaction. The wealthy often become more attached to money the more they have. Like a part of them, it becomes deciding factor in who they are. The more they have, the less they feel like they have, because they move into social circles or neighborhoods that are increasingly distinguished by money. What they have in an absolute sense is increasing, but relatively, as they move "up" in society, plateaus or even drops. The only way to find fulfillment is to step off the hamster wheel; to let Sisyphus' rock fall and walk away. 

> Whoever loves money never has enough; whoever loves wealth is never satisfied with their income. <p class="annotation">Ecclesiastes 5:10</p>

Those having more often worry more about what they have. Because they are more dependent their possessions, their castle, to defend them and satisfy them, they are more scared of losing it.  

<!-- > Do not lay up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moth and rust destroy and where thieves break in and steal, but lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust destroys and where thieves do not break in and steal. <p class="annotation">Matthew 6:19</p> -->

However futile and vulnerable, the climb is addicting. The addiction to wealth and money is perhaps the one addiction that our consumption culture encourages. 

Just like other forms of addiction, they not only impact the addict, but can damage people around them. Absent fathers and mothers chasing money up the corporate latter at the neglect of time spent nurturing and spiritually leading their children. Morally repugnant (but often legal, or otherwise unenforced) predation of the less circumstanced with payday loans or abuse of landlord power. 

A former Wall Street trader describes his past addiction, and societal consequences of overlooking it:

> In my last year on Wall Street my bonus was $3.6 million — and I was angry because it wasn’t big enough. I was 30 years old, had no children to raise, no debts to pay, no philanthropic goal in mind. I wanted more money for exactly the same reason an alcoholic needs another drink: I was addicted. I [had been] nagged by envy. On a trading desk everyone sits together, from interns to managing directors. When the guy next to you makes $10 million, $1 million or $2 million doesn’t look so sweet. <br><br> It was actually my absurdly wealthy bosses who helped me see the limitations of unlimited wealth... [They were] afraid of losing money, despite all that [they] had. These traders despised anything or anyone that threatened their bonuses. Ever see what a drug addict is like when he’s used up his junk? He’ll do anything — walk 20 miles in the snow, rob a grandma — to get a fix. Wall Street was like that. <br><br>Like alcoholics driving drunk, wealth addiction imperils everyone. Wealth addicts are, more than anybody, specifically responsible for the ever widening rift that is tearing apart our once great country. Wealth addicts are responsible for the vast and toxic disparity between the rich and the poor and the annihilation of the middle class. <p class="annotation"><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/19/opinion/sunday/for-the-love-of-money.html">For the Love of Money, The New York Times</a></p>

Stay skeptical of the cultural chase, and with gain be vigilant, guarding your heart from a creeping loyalties. Remember why we work.    

> Do not toil to acquire wealth; be discerning enough to desist. <p class="annotation">Proverbs 23:4</p>
