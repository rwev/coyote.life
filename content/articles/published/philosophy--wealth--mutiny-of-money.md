Title: The Mutiny of Money

It's common to consider diminishing marginal value of money to individuals. It's a concept foundational to microeconomics. It's assumed that more money -- or any other good -- makes us "better off", but how much better depends on how much one has.

Money, as observed in the third person, actually has not only diminishing marginal return, but that return also eventually becomes _negative_. 

For many, more money, above a certain threshold of excess, makes them _worse_ of -- less fulfilled, more greedy, yet even more dependent on it for validation, 


Turns out this is a biblical concept: money indeed possesses to power to destroy and to undermine. 

The answer is spiritual and psychological. The rich, high society become _more_ attached to money the more they have. It becomes increasingly important, and it becomes a deciding factor in who they are around, and the cycle continues.


With each rung, the stakes increase. Social circles change, and the cycle continues even more aggressively. The more they have, the less they feel like they have, because they move into neighborhoods that are increasingly distinguished by money. What they have in an absolute sense is increasing, but relatively, as they move "up" in society, plateaus or even drops. 

## Mo' Money, Mo' Problems

The worry more about what they have. Larger assets entail more management and potential losses. 

Again in the third person, I've seen the most fear in the people who have the least to lose (in the absolute sense). People having more, worry more about what they have. Because they are more dependent their possessions, their castle, to defend them and satisfy them, they are more scared of losing it.  

You can't lose what you don't have. 

## Wealth as an Addiction

The climb is addicting. 

The addiction to wealth and money is perhaps the one addiction that our culture encourages. 

Just like other forms of addiction, they not only impact the addict, but can damage people around them. Absent fathers and mothers chasing money up the corporate latter at the neglect of time spent nurturing and spiritually leading their children. Morally repugnant (but often legal, or otherwise unenforced) predation of the less circumstanced with payday loans or abuse of landlord power. 

A former Wall Street trader describes his addiction, and the damage its done:

> In my last year on Wall Street my bonus was $3.6 million — and I was angry because it wasn’t big enough. I was 30 years old, had no children to raise, no debts to pay, no philanthropic goal in mind. I wanted more money for exactly the same reason an alcoholic needs another drink: I was addicted. I [had been] nagged by envy. On a trading desk everyone sits together, from interns to managing directors. When the guy next to you makes $10 million, $1 million or $2 million doesn’t look so sweet. <br>> It was actually my absurdly wealthy bosses who helped me see the limitations of unlimited wealth... [They were] afraid of losing money, despite all that [they] had.<br> These traders despised anything or anyone that threatened their bonuses. Ever see what a drug addict is like when he’s used up his junk? He’ll do anything — walk 20 miles in the snow, rob a grandma — to get a fix. Wall Street was like that.<br> I’d always looked enviously at the people who earned more than I did; now, for the first time, I was embarrassed for them, and for me. <br>Like alcoholics driving drunk, wealth addiction imperils everyone. Wealth addicts are, more than anybody, specifically responsible for the ever widening rift that is tearing apart our once great country. Wealth addicts are responsible for the vast and toxic disparity between the rich and the poor and the annihilation of the middle class. <p class="annotation"><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/19/opinion/sunday/for-the-love-of-money.html">For the Love of Money, NYT</a></p>
