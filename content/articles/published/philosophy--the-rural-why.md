Title: The Rural Why
Category: philosophy
Status: published

A defense and explanation of the pursuit of a free, rural life.

Those living in cities or along the culturally different and more populated area of the coasts often speak of rural folks in "flyover" country with disdain, condescension, and even resentment, due the recent political election outcomes. Even with very little first hand (primary) experience with rural culture or people, the rural lifestyle is often wholly written off as ignorant, primitive, uncultured, and named with derogatory slang (left as an exercise to the reader).

The rural cultures deserves more than the judgments and labels, and while many of the stereotypes exists for a reason, there is more to it than meets the eye. The labels and unfounded assumptions are picked out, isolated, and addressed, one by one. 

## Asocial, Escapist, Reclusive

Places aren't lonely: people are. With the rampant superficiality, posturing, and materialism American cities are globally infamous for, Americans struggle with mental health and loneliness more than ever, despite theoretically being more "connected" with the rest of humanity than ever via
 shallow social media relationships. 

Per [supply and demand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supply_and_demand), people value each unit of something based on how many units they have. Per unit value goes up as units possessed goes down. In cities, continuous and overwhelming supply of interpersonal encounters means the cheapening of
 the value of interaction, manifested by impatience or disrespect levied upon strangers in public places. 

It isn't just etiquette that is lost in this adjustment of value: helping a stranger in need or distress becomes a more foreign concept, as people [assume the system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bystander_effect) will deal with the issue. This phenomenon leads to generally less compassion for
 equals and the degeneration of the neighborhood and community, once key structures to our Western society. Cities harbor the worst of Western individualism. 
 
But in rural areas, where human contact is limited, the Good Samaritan tradition lives on. Coherent, value-bound neighborhoods exist for uplifting companionship and reciprocated assistance during urgent situations. Individuals cannot hide behind anonymity like they can in crowds; instead, they
 held accountable by depth of interdependency. The [Silver Rule](https://medium.com/@jeffdesjardins/the-silver-rule-taleb-and-the-slippery-slope-to-interventionism-ef6baef17c23), "do not to others what you donâ€™t want them to do to you" is implicitly enforced. Your neighbor has your back.

## Assumption: Poor, Incapable, Desperate

Although rural populations do indeed possess less, there is more appreciation and contentment and less envy. It's more about what you have and how it serves you in surviving and navigating the environment, not an endless comparison game with focus on what cosmetics others have. The positive
 relationship
 between
 simplicity and
 fulfillment
 abound in the traditions of cultures around the globe. In principle, rural living emphasizes what one _has_, not what one has not.

The rural life offer freedom from materialism and comparison. While urban and suburban areas may be rich in resources, they are themselves consumed by consumerism and excess. Free from the crushing societal pressures of conformity, image-based judgement, and the bloat of the politics of large government and  organizations, rural folks stay within their means and are generally more resourceful and self-reliant, if for no other reason than the relative lack of safety and comfort infrastructure on which the consumption and blunder feed. You can't spend money you don't have if there is
  no where to spend it.

In the age of globalism, the worth of a society is derived by economics measurements like payroll, un/-employment and production and bureaucratic flab like certificates and degrees, rural areas certainly fall behind. But these metrics are not a perfect proxy of the satisfaction, fulfillment, jo
, or peace. The human race is richer _and_ more discontent than it's ever been. Rural living helps one escape that equation and rat race entirely.
