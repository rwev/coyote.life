A defense and explanation of the pursuit of a free, rural life, inspired by a work of similar motivation, but for the classic practice and art of fishing, [The River Why](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_River_Why).

## The Living Soul of America 

> All the other stuff, the love, the democracy, the floundering into lust, is a sort of by-play. The essential American soul is hard, isolate, stoic, and a killer. It has never yet melted. <p class="annotation">D.H. Lawrence</p>
