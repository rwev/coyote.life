Why should _you_ should drive an old, cheap vehicle, colloquially known as "rust-buckets", "rattle-traps", and "ol 'beaters"?

## Freedom

There are two dimensions to freedom here, closely related: _monetary_ and _material_. 

### Material 

Old cars, particularly off-road-capable light duty SUVs, are generally already well-worn, and have scores of scuffs and scrapes and dents and broken non-essentials (cosmetic elements), otherwise called _personality_ with admiration. 

There is no minor damage that could be done to the vehicle that would affect its service life, or incite any level of depreciation. Any new stratches, dings, dirt, stains, or other cosmetic imperfections would blend right in. 

Spilled cup of coffee on the dash and carpet? No worries, it'll dry out and match the mud. Fender bender backing out of the driveway? Not bad, now the bumper is symmetrical. Dirty from a long trip down a rough dirt road? Let the rain take care of it when it comes.

Defects from healthy wear and tear are the standard, so live free.

Contrasting that to the ownership of driving a newer vehicle, everything becomes a worry. 

Payments and financial liability aside, nicer things tie up larger amounts of wealth, and wealth is something generally to be protected. Damage to nicer things costs more money, whether in depreciation or dollars out the door for repairs. Wealth tied up in a newer (still depreciating) vehicles is often an order of magnitude more than the two-decades-old beater, and values along the depreciation curve are more sensitive to cosmetic flaws the younger the car is.Protecting against such the loss of value and thus wealth can consume considerable mental space for the owner.   

Spilled cup of coffee on the dash and carpet? Need to find a wet-dry vacuum stat, before it soaks in and dries, with a shampoo to come. Fender bender backing out of the driveway? Probably need a whole new bumper with a coat of paint to match, installed by an authorized mechanic. Dirty from a long trip down a rough dirt road? Get it to the wash ASAP lest the gloss finish wear. 

The financial and perhaps more importantly _mental_ costs associated with newer car ownership are significantly higher.  

Material freedom boils down to _owning your stuff_, not letting your stuff own you. 

### Monetary

The vehicles that are theoretically best suited for backcountry, off-road travel are rarely the ones out there.  The brand new rigs with the tunes, the upgrades, winch, roll-bars, are the ones sitting in driveways and apartment complex parking lots, day after day, weekend after weekend, in mint & unused (of course well washed) condition. 

The ones out there in the field getting dirty make a ramshackle group of aged vehicles. 

The cost of wear, even "honest wear", is higher on newer things, as it accelerates the already high cost of depreciation. The scary risk of loss to any avoidable damage keeps the expensive vehicles at home. 

In the words of this [fellow r/overlanding user](https://www.reddit.com/r/overlanding/comments/ebfqtr/the_most_important_feature_of_a_longterm/).

> I've met a ton of people having massive global adventures in POS unreliable vehicles all over the world. From Honduras to Bolivia and Botswana to Kenya there are people driving $500 vehicles having a blast... I've never met anyone having global adventures in a super-expensive super-reliable vehicle, <em>because they never went on the adventure... the most important feature of a long-term expedition vehicle: no payments!</em><p>u/grecy</p>

Driving a $500 Jeep, he has _done_ more than others following a different model:pouring money into their overbuilt & pristine rigs that sit in their garage and depreciate while they are stuck at working paying for them.

The debt load and general financial strain associated with high-priced vehicles puts the bird in a cage, and should be avoided at all costs: choose _doing_ over having. 

#### Self-Insuring

By owning an old vehicle and having fewer monetary resources tied up (fewer eggs in the basket), one is free to bear the risk of collision themselves, saving hundreds, even thousands of dollars per year on the cost of full-collision insurance. 

## Reliability & The Bathtub Curve 

The common misconception about old cars, and thus a justification for buying a new one is that newer cars are more reliable, while old ones are ticking time bombs. 

Experientially and anecdotally, that has not been the case. I've had more friends buy practically new cars only to have catastrophic mechanical problems only months or even weeks later. 

How could this be? 

The [bathtub curve](http://www.catb.org/jargon/html/B/bathtub-curve.html) concept, born in the tech industry which describes the likelihood of failure of a device over time: 

> Common term for the curve (resembling an end-to-end section of one of those claw-footed antique bathtubs) that describes the expected failure rate of electronics with time: initially high, dropping to near 0 for most of the system's lifetime, then rising again as it ‘tires out’. See also burn-in period, infant mortality.

New cars are freshly composed complex systems, with unproven design and components, while old cars are proven systems refined by the trials of use. 

Any bugs in an experienced system have been ironed out and the vehicle has settled into an equilibrium of balanced working order, while the maturity cycle of young system is uncharted and bound to be wrought with unforeseen troubles, whether design concerns or parts failure (as true for life as it is for vehicles).

Old cars are "burned in" and matured into adulthood, while new cars are still prone to the spontaneous and unpredictable sensitivities of infancy. 

## Simplicity

In the case when an older vehicle needs critical maintenance, which may be less often than an infant vehicle, it is likely to cost less (time & money), because the repair procedure is less complicated, and thus self-repair can realistically be performed with amateur knowledge and access to tools.

Even if DIY isn't an option, the simplicity of the system as well as cheaper, more ubiquitous replacement parts will make the trips to the shop less expensive, involving fewer hours of labor.
