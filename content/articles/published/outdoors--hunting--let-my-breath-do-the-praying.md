A poem by [kschirms](/author/kschirms.html), reflecting on our [first](/first-elk-hunt-retrospective.html) successful big game hunt.

> <strong>Let My Breath Do The Praying</strong><br><br>Left on the way into the willowed valley<br>Her energy now becomes my own.<br>Bone exposed to air and snow.<br>Scavengers find an easy meal.<br>Red paint flows down snow coated ribcage<br>Spreading as the next stage begins.<br>Me, I’m cold.<br>Feet frozen from a strenuous hike in<br>Sweat (and tears) turning to ice.<br>There are no smells in the cold starlit night.<br>Only sounds.<br>I will remember them as I wait for sleep.<br>Saddened, thankful, bone-tired from carrying bone-in.<br>It’s an ages old, neglected act.<br>To take a life, honor it, survive on it.<br>I wonder, does the herd miss her?<br>Or are they grateful they weren’t the one to receive the bullet.<br>It’s a quick way to go.<br>A rather painless death for an existence fraught<br>with constant evasion of predation.<br>Coyotes yip. Wolf tracks cut across the ridge. Only the briefest shadow of an owl.<br>Am I now under the same category: predator?<br>Food chain, flow of energy.<br>The grass will one day feed on my body.<br>Suddenly my lungs feel full, eyes sharpened, back bone tingled.<br>The granite-faced mountain peak directs my attention heavenward.<br>Oh, how rarely I let my breath do the praying.<br>
