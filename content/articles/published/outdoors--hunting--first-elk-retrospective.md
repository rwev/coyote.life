Title: First Elk Hunt Retrospective

Tags: elk,outdoors,adventure

Yesterday was my last day of my first season of hunting. 

New to big game hunting, I definitely bit off a large chunk of a challenge by choosing to chase elk in high and open country.

The hunt really started after applying for two elk controlled hunts in May, and successfully drawing my second choice, hunt #2086, an antlerless hunt open December 10 - 31 in unit 37A. 

The first preparation was taking part in a sustainable / ethical hunting class organized by the Backcountry Hunters and Anglers. The class started at the necessary square one, as I knew very little in general about scouting, stalking, shooting and butchering big game in the backcountry, all of which was covered by the class. (Side plug: if you enjoy free and open access to wilderness for recreation, hunting, or fishing, I highly recommend joining BHA). The course was led by veteran wilderness hunters with many seasons under their belts, with an emphasis on public land hunting techniques (as opposed to private, restricted, fee-controlled ranches). It gave me a good start on how to approach the massive tracts of public land available to sportsmen in Idaho, but in the end, there is no substitute for figuring it out yourself.

Getting started as a brand new hunter planning a new hunt in a massive state, the exclusivity of the hunting community was a turnoff. Very few are willing to share their general techniques, such as strategy, timing, set up, etc, and even fewer with geographic location. It's all a secret. Everyone needs help in the beginning, either as a first generational western hunter or as a inherited hunter, but once they have their spot, there seems to be very little willingness to pay it forward.

Difficulties aside, I began scouting electronically, as the five hour drive up to the unit from Boise is restrictive and potentially futile, as elk may move before the hunt starts. 

In locating the elk, tips from managing IDFG biologists were accurate and helpful, despite my previous skepticism of anyone really sharing knowledge.

There are a handful of takeaways from this years season.

## One Week Minimum Hunt

Due to the migratory and evasive nature of elk, scouting them one month and hunting them the next isn't realistic. You need to hunt them for a contiguous week in order to first find them and their current travel routines, then setup a hunt approach. 

There is also a huge factor that luck plays in making a hunt successful. You have to be at the right place at the right time. Elk aren't predictable: even if you know where they bed down and where they are feeding, they remain an autonomous creature that can direct thenmselves out of reach at the last moment. Shifting winds can ruin an otherwise perfect approach. Or maybe the elk just decide to change it up. A longer hunt offers more chances for success, like placing many bets: the odds are higher that all factors come together necessary for a successful hunt the longer you are out there. 

## Hike, Hike, Hike
 
I had heard this from BHA folks as well as other authorities in hunting (such as Randy Newberg). You have to go where the others don't walk to go. It seems elk are smarter than others give them credit for. They learn how to remain out of sight or inaccessible from a majority of hunters by staying away from human paths of travel either via distance and elevation. 

All of the elk we saw on our trip would have been impossible to spot, let alone to stalk, without seriously tough uphill, off-trail, snowy hiking. 

Do what others aren't. Most want to drive around in their truck and glass, or try and run into them on their ATV. If you want above average results, you can't have the average approach.
