Yesterday was my last day of my first season of big game hunting. 

New to big game hunting, I definitely bit off a large chunk by choosing to chase elk in high and open country. With a [small minority](https://idfg.idaho.gov/ifwis/huntplanner/stats/?season=controlled&game=elk&yr=2018) of elk hunters being successful each year, including those from generational families of hunters and local knowledge, it would be an uphill battle. 

# Planning and Preparation

The hunt really started after applying for two elk controlled hunts in May, and successfully drawing my second choice, hunt #20XX, an antlerless hunt open December 10 - 31 in unit 3X. 

The first preparation was taking part in a sustainable / ethical hunting class organized by the Backcountry Hunters and Anglers (BHA) months before the hunt opened.

The class started at the necessary square one, as I knew very little in general about scouting, stalking, shooting and butchering big game in the backcountry, all of which was covered by the class. The course was led by veteran wilderness hunters with many seasons under their belts, with an emphasis on public land hunting techniques (as opposed to private, restricted, fee-controlled ranches). It gave me a good start on how to approach the massive tracts of public land available to sportsmen in Idaho, but in the end, there is no substitute for figuring it out yourself.
  
Getting started as a brand new hunter planning a new hunt in a massive state, the exclusivity of the hunting community was a turnoff. Despite the otherwise welcoming BHA community, very few are willing to share their general techniques, such as strategy, timing, set up, etc, and even fewer with geographic location. It's all a secret. 

On a separate note, everyone needs help in the beginning, either as a first generation western hunter or as a hunter of family tradition, but once they have their spot, there seems to be very little willingness to pay it forward. I hope to change this phenomenon as I establish myself as a hunter. 

Difficulties aside, I began scouting electronically, as the five hour drive up to the unit from Boise is restrictive and potentially futile, as elk may move before the hunt starts. 

In narrowing down the swaths of open and public land to areas most likely to hold elk, tips from managing Idaho Fish and Game biologists were accurate and helpful, despite my previous skepticism of anyone really sharing knowledge.

To getting a bearing on where to stay or camp, and reasonable access to good hunting areas (both in availability and hike-in distance), [onX](https://onxmaps.com) was irreplaceable.

Although a whole host of layers and data maps are available through the platform, just the private / public property aggregation layer makes it worth the price. It adds a whole dimension to scouting and navigation, and planning approaches and access with higher levels of certainty, as regulatory / governing body borders and private property exclusion can be reasonably navigated without surprise blockages or potential trespassing. 

The line and area measurement tools, for which there are also good open source equivalents, can even be a decent substitute for a laser rangefinder, when one can use geographic features and satellite imagery cross-referencing to measure routes and distances to animals. 

# The Takeaways

After seven days out on the hunt, and much learned about the area and the elk that inhabit it, I ended with a successful take on the last day. Here are a handful of thoughts from this year's season to carry forward into future hunts.

## One Week Minimum Hunt

Due to the migratory and evasive nature of elk, scouting them one month and hunting them the next isn't realistic. You need to hunt them for a contiguous week in order to first find them and their current travel routines, then setup a hunt approach. 

There is also a huge factor that luck plays in making a hunt successful. You have to be at the right place at the right time. Elk aren't predictable: even if you know where they bed down and where they are feeding, they remain an autonomous creature that can direct themselves out of reach at the last moment. Shifting winds can ruin an otherwise perfect approach. Or maybe the elk just decide to change it up. A longer hunt offers more chances for success, like placing many bets: the odds are higher that all factors come together necessary for a successful hunt the longer you are out there. 

## Hike, Hike, Hike
 
I had heard this from BHA folks as well as other authorities in hunting (such as Randy Newberg). You have to go where the others don't walk to go. It seems elk are smarter than others give them credit for. They learn how to remain out of sight or inaccessible from a majority of hunters by staying away from human paths of travel or sight either via distance and elevation. 

All of the elk we saw on our trip would have been impossible to spot, let alone to stalk, without seriously tough uphill, off-trail, snowy hiking. 

Do what others aren't. Most want to drive around in their truck and glass, or try and run into them on their ATV. If you want above average results, you can't have the average approach.

Go where the elk are, and where humans aren't. 

## Hurry Up and Wait

A widely known M.O. of the military, the "hurry up and wait" mentality is critical to hunting. With sheer time in the field being critical, it is important to maximize time in the field, much is which is, in turn, spent waiting, being patient for animals to move or show themselves, or posting up and looking. Like the first point, maximizing time spent in the field maximizes the chances of finding elk in a position to set up on or stalk them.

## All Things Come Together

Many things need to take place to end up with a successful kill, including, but not limited to, and in this order, for a spot-and-stalk:

1. Find the elk
2. Given wind, topographic, and ground features, make a concealed approach with time before the end of shooting light
3. Get quietly into shooting position, without intermittent unfavorable wind shift, and without unseen members of herd (if present) detecting you
4. Make a calm, deliberate shot with a zeroed in rifle and steady hands

This was a hard lesson learned. 

On the fourth day, I spotted a small herd bedded down in large timber on a steep slope, with just enough time to get to them before nightfall. 

I was lucky enough to make a downwind approach, with the prevailing wind remaining the same throughout the duration, without getting seen or smelled by unknown members of the larger concealed herd, and get set up in a good shooting position not more than 175 yards from a fair game specimen. 

Pulled the trigger and felt great about the shot, but after my target took off uphill spooked with the rest of the herd, I knew that something was up with my rifle: I had fallen hard onto it and bashed it into a rocky hillside. It had lost its zero, and was now shooting at least 18" right at the distance to target. (I'm thankful that I missed the animal completely, with the bullet traveling clean in front of it, as opposed to a gut shot.)

## Always On

Due to the previously mentioned autonomous, unpredictable nature of animals, one needs to be alert and ready to move on them at all times. 

This year, a herd, from which I took my animal, showed themselves 7.5 miles into a 8 mile off-trail hike, on the last 0.5 miles back to the vehicle access point. Exhausted and pretty well checked out for the season, and already reflecting on how my first season went, I look up onto the ridge to my left, and a herd crests over it, and my subsequent stalk ended up being successful. Had I not been paying attention in those final moments, I wouldn't have even noticed. 

In all, the mentally and physically grueling challenge and the final success made my year as 2019's capstone achievement.
