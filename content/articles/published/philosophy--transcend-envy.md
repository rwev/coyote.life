Title: Transcending Envy, Redefining Success
Category: philosophy
Status: published

Envy has a myriad of manifestations. 

- Fear of not being enough, of failure, of inadequacy
- Schadenfreude, or ill-will-wishing upon others, spite, revenge
- Constant comparison to others
- Rejoicing while others weep; weeping as others rejoice
- Unnecessary, misapplied competition
- Lack of fulfillment, contentment, peace; ingratitude

As I became an adult and found my way as a self-reliant individual in the capitalist world, my behavior became increasingly ends-driven. I oppressed or disciplined-away any pursuits that weren't in some way monetized. Every decision became an economic one; creativity dwindled. My personal 
interests were ever more career-related. Young and impressionable, I took all queues from the typical American dream: success is monetary, and a professional career makes for a life well lived.

I didn't do things sincerely because I wanted to, or because I felt a higher calling. I did them because they won me the approval or adoration of mentors and peers. My studies and work became simply means to the end of material abundance and praises of others. 

It only took a few months as a "professional" take full notice of the failures in this peer- / envy-driven journey. The wrong turns became evident. I wasn't happy, fulfilled, or well-rested. There was something wrong, and whatever it was, the money, for which I traded my life and potential, 
wasn't helping treat it. The endless comparison, fear of not having enough or not measuring up, drove me into a corner.

I was following the world's standards, where one successfully builds a career

- based on reputation and employable (monetized) skills, 
- proliferated by competition and comparison,
- elevated by posturing and image-making,
- rewarded by growth and influence,

These building blocks of worldly success quickly slip into the territory of envy if unchecked.

Seven years after becoming a legal adult, I've begun to think independently and settle into my own envy-less value system around work pursuits. 

> Better to have one handful with tranquility than two handfuls with toil and chasing after the wind.
    <p class="annotation">
    Ecclesiastes 4:6
    </p>

We will never achieve perfect satisfaction or fulfillment from our labor on this earth. After the fall, that is the [curse](https://www.bible.com/bible/111/gen.3.17). But only a fool would fold their hands and ruin themselves by not attempting to compete and accomplish. This doesn't justify laziness _or_ overwork (idolatry); instead we examine _motivation._ 

You will never experience the fullness of your potential, what you were created or designed for, as long as you base your actions on the actions of others. You cannot compare your way to peace, just as you can't win by chasing the drifting wind. 

Remove what makes you feel less than, causes comparison and discontentment, or stirs envy or jealousy. Less is more when it leads to a greater sense of peace and contentment.

The moment we begin to compare and become jealous and envious, we lose our ability to truly care for others. Envy is selfish. Envy steals one's attention and takes two handfuls for itself. 

Find your one handful and your tranquility. Thrive there, and change the world of others.
