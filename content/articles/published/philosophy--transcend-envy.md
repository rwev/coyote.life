Title: Transcending Envy, Redefining Success
Category: philosophy
Status: published

Envy has a myriad of manifestations. 

- Fear of not being enough, of failure, of inadequacy
- Schadenfreude, or ill-will-wishing upon others, spite, revenge
- Constant comparison to others
- Rejoicing while others weep; weeping as others rejoice
- Unnecessary, misapplied competition
- Lack of fulfillment, contentment, peace; ingratitude

As I became an adult and found my way as a self-reliant individual in the capitalist world, my behavior became increasingly ends-driven. I oppressed or disciplined-away any pursuits that weren't in some way monetized. Every decision became an economic one; creativity dwindled. My personal 
interests were ever more career-related. Young and impressionable, I took all queues from the typical American dream: success is monetary, and a professional career makes for a life well lived.

I didn't do things sincerely because I wanted to, or because I felt a higher calling. I did them because they won me the approval or adoration of mentors and peers. My studies and work became simply means to the end of material abundance and praises of others. 

It only took a few months as a "professional" take full notice of the failures in this peer-/envy-driven journey. The wrong turns became evident. I wasn't happy, fulfilled, or well-rested. There was something wrong, and whatever it was, the money, for which I traded my life and potential, 
wasn't helping treat it. The endless comparison, fear of not having enough or not measuring up, drove me into a corner.

I was following the world's standards, where a successful career is predicated on employable (comparable and monetized) skills and often requires posturing, image-making, and accrual of influence, which can be proxies of envy if the heart is left unchecked.

Seven years into adulthood, I've begun to think independently and settle into my own value system around work pursuits. 

> Better to have one handful with tranquility than two handfuls with toil and chasing after the wind.

    Ecclesiastes 4:6

We will never achieve perfect satisfaction or fulfillment from our labor on this earth. After the fall, that is the [curse](https://www.bible.com/bible/111/gen.3.17). Nonetheless, only a fool would "fold their hands and ruin themselves" by not working diligently. Neither laziness nor overwork are justified; instead, it seeks balance and calls for an examination of _motivation._ 

We will never experience the extent of our individual potentials, what we were uniquely created or designed for, as long as we base our actions on the actions of others. We cannot compare or achieve our way to contentment, just as we can't win by chasing the drifting wind. 

Envy is self-serving: it steals one's attention and takes two handfuls for itself. The moment we become envious, we lose our ability to truly care for and cultivate others through our work.

Isolate and eliminate what makes you feel inferior, jealous, or discontentment. Less (from the world) is more when it leads to a greater sense of peace and satisfaction.
