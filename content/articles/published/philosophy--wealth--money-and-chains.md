Title: Money & Chains

The Industrial Revolution brought a level of prosperity never before seen by humanity. Freed from the repetitive and volatile life on farms and fields, people gained an accessible and reliable supply of basic needs. 

This advancement liberated society. It was then that the concept of free time became a commonplace concept, There was more time to reflect, focus, discover, _think_. 

In recent years of the Information Age, with the continued proliferation of marketing strategy and social media, society has relapsed. We are more distracted than ever, busier than ever, with our attention monetized, interpersonal relationships polluted by marketing and consumption-centric comparison. Society continues to be enslaved, this time by the pursuit of more. Recent technological development, while promising "progress" in the depth of the human experience, instead has made it shallower than ever. 

After witnessing the condition of many colleagues at a growing corporation, hating their existence at work, not present or engaged, preferring to be anywhere else on earth than at their desk watching the clock. Celebrating Friday; despising Mondays. Meanwhile, they can't seem to imagine life
 differently. They don't, or aren't willing to, recognize alternatives. This is the existence that they grew into, were taught, inundated with, and receive positive confirmation for - the stereotypical, the safe, the manufactured definition of success. This amounts to a disappointing lack of autonomy, independence, and self-reflection. 

Many colleagues earn amounts of money far and above the costs required for life's necessities, with the remaining excess offering the flexibility for the pursuit of free time personal interests, sabbaticals, job gaps or unpaid time-off, and long vacations. Instead of unlocking freedom, the
 excess resources became collateral to banks offering access to unreasonable amount of credit, absurd multiples of discretionary yearly income. After subtracting living expenses and some expensive tastes, the loans take decades to pay off. The young professionals do what they think young professionals do: take the banks offer for that house and for that car. 

Further, the property underlying debt are often nowhere near necessary. A brand new, loaded out, overpowered extended cab truck is of little utility to a software developer or business manager is who commutes to work and doesn't have the time or range of interests to get any use out of it, but
 they buy it nonetheless. A two bedroom house in the suburbs makes little sense for a busy bachelor, with hardly and time or energy left at the end of the day to even use the kitchen or do basic cleaning and maintenance, let alone the unused rooms. 
 
However ludicrous, the cycle perpetuates, as each generation of the information age buys the advertising and unknowingly makes the interests of the ruling financial class their own. What could set us free wraps us in chains instead.
