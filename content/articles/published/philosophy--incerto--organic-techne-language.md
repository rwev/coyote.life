Title: Language Learning & Formal Education

Formal language education rarely leads to real-world language competency.

Despite the certainty and structure that words on a page provide, the language "in the wild" has characteristic and feel to them that neither books nor your teacher with a four-year language degree and a semester abroad can convey. The _culture_ of language is inherently incommunicable over the pages of a textbook, in the classroom, or for the matter anywhere outside of said culture.

So long as language is understood and used to communicate ideas, whether or not it conforms to the institutional definition is irrelevant. Arguably, "proper" speech, along with "etiquette", have been used by the knowledge class to oppress and enforce inferiority.

Those subjugated to institutional education may think of unconventional speech -- local or socioeconomic dialect, thick accent, gangster talk -- as illegitimate or even repulsive. Those who speak in such a way are uncultured, uneducated, or apathetic to the "one true language" defined by a language authority in books and spoken by high society.

As both a tool and part of culture, language isn't defined by or constrained by history, formality, or a centralized authority. If language is being used _as a language_, it is legitimate. This legitimacy isn't verified through top-down codification. Language is home-grown and user-driven. It continuously evolves to serve those who use it.

What comes first, the institutional structure (grammar, spelling, style, punctuation, pronunciation) or the practical application of the language in casual conversation?

Believing language to be defined by textbooks and dictionaries is akin to believing institutions are the source of knowledge. In reality, information flows the other direction: bureaucracies manage the information and discovery of the real world. Language is organic and developed "on the streets", bottom-up, in real time, not in retrospect by linguists, anthropologists, or historians, or more broadly, bureaucrats and central planners.

## Theory and Practice

Graduating from a top-tier public university with a degree in mathematics, I felt empowered to conquer any problem the world could offer. After so many long days and nights in the library pouring over textbooks and exams, I had learned so much, right?

It only took a couple of months before it felt like I was starting over again. Or, to put it bluntly, that my degree was useless. Nothing I had learned applied directly to the problems faced in my work as a quantitative trader. The real world was _messy_; it didn't fit into the constructs we used to organize and diagnose the toy problems of university.

Too often people get sucked into the "education for education's sake" mentality. They become hypnotized by the clean-and-tidy "beautiful" nature of academics and end up using their reductive academics as a shield from the anxiety-inducing tangled world.

This is a primary reason why so many "good students" have something like a failure-to-launch after graduation. In school, one can be methodical, first triaging problems to fit an prepared flow, and then applying a prescribed solution. Work seems chaotic and disorganized; there aren't certain problems with certain known solutions. The real world demands learning how to navigate the chaos and improvise, and the educational system has not prepared them to do so. It all seems hacky to those who have come of age and developed their mentality within the rigidity of a canned education.

The [Greeks distinguishied](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/episteme-techne/) _epistêmê_, knowledge, from _technê_, craft, art, or skill; these domains are roughly analogous to the modern divisions of theory and practice.

>  In our era, the paradigm of theory is pure mathematics, that has no obvious application to practical problems...
>
>  At the other end of the spectrum is craft, for example, carpentry, which is so enmeshed in material application that it resists any general explanation but must be learned by practice...
>
>  Theory [may be] conducted at so great a remove from the facts, the province of practice, that it can lose touch with them. Indeed, at the level of practice, concrete experience might be all we need.

Formal educational curricula is too heavily involved in teaching theoretical _epistêmê_ that many students are unable to successful transition into real world which demands _technê_.

Improvisation and unstructured learning solving needs to be added to the forefront of education. As for language: learn it on the skreets.
