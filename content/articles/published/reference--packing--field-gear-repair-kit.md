The failure of gear can ruin outdoor ventures, contribute to general misery or loss of morale, and even create dangerous situations. Be prepared to fix it. 

A leak in a rainjacket, a major tear in a sleeping bag, or the breakage of a strap or attachment point in load-bearing equipment (LBE) can quickly knock a trip or mission off track.

This small kit is a small burden for the risk mitigation that it provides. Despite the low probability of needing to perform gear repairs under dire circumstances, the low weight (half an ounce) and profile (credit card size) is a very affordable considering the insurance that it provides.
