The failure of gear can ruin outdoor missions, contribute to general misery or loss of morale, and create dangerous situations. Be prepared to fix it. 

A leak in a rainjacket, a major tear in a sleeping bag, or the falling apart of a strap or attachment point in load-bearing system can quickly knock a trip or mission off track.
