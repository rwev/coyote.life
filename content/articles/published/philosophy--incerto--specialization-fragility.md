The modern, global economy is powered by specialization: the levels of efficiency it offers enables mass production of our day. 

Specialization implies that an entity is very good at performing its actions in a static environment with a set of predictable, replicable factors that are either constant or exhibit [ergodic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ergodicity) behavior. A tangible example of this is on the assembly line: for a worker to contribute her operation to the line an industrial level of efficiency, the state of the input and output object is strictly controlled. 

The relationship between specialization and efficiency, though primarily economic concepts, extends to any space in which entities interact with their environment - an environment which, in the real world, involves uncertainty, with certainty. 

A specialized entity must only be prepared for what it will experience, and in the case of a constant or ergodic factors, what will be experienced is "known", and as such the entity must only invest in its ability to operate within this bubble. 

In this condition, the entity optimizes. Assumptions and optimization are positively correlated: the more assumptions that can be made, and the stronger they are, greater are yields of optimization. Here the neglect of the preparedness and redundancy begins: unless a tangible or intangible asset increases profit to the task or justified within the (now reduced) realm of possibility or framework of assumptions, it is written off as waste, a anti-necessity to be trimmed away.

Specialization is naive: it assumes a world of constants, while failing to preparing for the unknown, or something even acknowledging it. With it comes fragility; entities that perform only in the space of the known, the static, the predictable are over-invested in their environment and unable to adapt when  assumptions become untrue. 

## Profit & Fragility

When profit is the song, efficiency is the chorus. Efficiency _enables_ profit. Profits cannot be increased without efficiency. This is the essence of capitalist / competitive /  laissez-faire / invisible-hand economics.

Entities in such an economy become overspecialized and oversensitive. They can't adapt. As soon as their set of assumptions their business model is built on fall apart, so do they, also bringing down the networks with a domino effect that propagates to take out their neighbors. Fully aware of this, they rent-seek and protect themselves with bureaucracy or even public sympathy.  

So what is the solution? Entities in the market could become more aware of downside, and make themselves more adaptable. This involves investing in assets, perhaps intellectual or infrastructural, that don't immediately boost the bottom line but expand general robustness. 

Just the _mindset_ that change is near and the static doesn't survive makes a difference. Pop the bubble of assumptions bottom-up.
