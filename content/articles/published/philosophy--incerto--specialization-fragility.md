Title: Specialization is Fragility
Category: philosophy/incerto

Specialization naively assumes a world of knowns and fails to prepare for what is to come. 

Specialization itself means an "adaptation to a specific function or environment". The specialized are very good at performing under predictable, replicable, constant (or [ergodic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ergodicity)) conditions. Consider an assembly line: for a station worker to contribute to the line at an industrial level of efficiency, the acceptable inputs and outputs are strictly controlled - any deviations from expected state break the chain of operations catastrophically. 
                                                                                     
Specialized entities assume a continuation of the static in the current environment, or simply that things will always be how they are. Assumptions enable optimization. The more assumptions, and the stronger they are, the greater are yields of optimization. Here the neglect of redundancy and
 preparedness begins: unless an asset increases profit to the specific task or is justified within the now-reduced realm of possibility, it is written off as waste, an anti-necessity to be trimmed away. 

A specialized entity is built for what it will experience, assumed to be known, and as such only invests in its ability to operate within this framework of assumptions. They are over-invested in their immediate context. Unable to adapt when assumptions become untrue, the specialized are fragile, falling apart with their assumptions.

In the short term, such a specialized configuration is efficient when operating under the regime it was optimized for. There are fewer layers of redundancy or resources reserved for unknown stress events. 

In the long run, however, inefficiencies of the redundancy type tend to prove useful. Take the Soviet Union for example, which achieved a high level of food security as a side effect of top-down, bureaucratic, and centralized economic (mis-)management: 

> Calamities were avoided after the breakdown of the Soviet state because food production was inefficient and full of unintentional redundancies, which ended up working in favor of stability. Stalin played with agriculture, causing his share of famine. But he and his successors never managed to
get agriculture to become “efficient,” that is, centralized and optimized as it is today in America, so every town had the staples growing around it. This was costlier, as they did not get the benefits of specialization, but this local lack of specialization allowed people to have access to all
 varieties of food in spite of the severe breakdown of the institutions. <br><br>In the United States, we burn twelve calories in transportation for every calorie of nutrition; in Soviet Russia, it was one-to-one. One can imagine what could happen to the United States (or Europe) in the event of
 food disruptions. 


The relationship between specialization and robustness extends to any space in which entities interact with their uncertain, dynamic, stochastic environment, whether the economy, the natural ecosystem, or one's personal existence. 

> Specialization is the response to a very stable habitat free of abrupt changes, redundancy of pathways the response to a more variegated one... Mother Nature does not like overspecialization, as it limits evolution and weakens the animals. <br><br> Layers of redundancy are the central risk
> management property of natural systems. We humans have two kidneys (this may even include accountants), extra spare parts, and extra capacity in many, many things (say, lungs, neural system, arterial apparatus)... Redundancy is ambiguous because it seems like a waste if nothing unusual happens. Except that something unusual happens—usually... Redundancy is opportunistic.

My friend Ben shared the analogy from nature. Consider the panda: they eat one specific thing, bamboo, and only exist in full health within very narrow climate and habitat tolerances. In today's dynamic world, populations struggle as their delicate forests get cut down and global temperatures rise. Humans have intervened to assist them, an innocent but incapable species. Their likeness even forms the emblem of the World Wildlife Foundation (WWF), perhaps the most well-known international nature conservation group, which slows the inevitable demise of wild pandas. 

Now consider the cockroach: they thrive around the globe, infesting the dwellings of encroaching humans, perhaps even benefiting from our presence and influence. In Armageddon, I'd wager cockroaches would be among the few survivors. Their dietary and environmental tolerances are extreme. Pandas
 are fragile and static; cockroaches are versatile and robust, they adapt and overcome, and may even be anti-fragile, gaining from the stressors and stimulation of change. 

So what is the solution? Be the cockroach. 

Entities should become more aware of downside, and make themselves more adaptable. This involves investing in assets, perhaps intellectual or infrastructural, that don't immediately boost the bottom line but expand general robustness and optionality, even if, at first glance, it appears to be
 an inefficient redundancy. Just the _mindset_ that change is near and the static or unprepared don't survive makes a difference.
