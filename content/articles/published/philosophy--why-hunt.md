Title: Why Hunt
Category: philosophy

Hunters have a public-relations issue, with wide swaths of the public characterizing hunters as brutish men hellbent for blood. 

True to human tendency, the offenses of the belligerent spoil the reputation of the respectful.

Hunting is essentially violent, but isn't killing for its own sake. The killing part is a necessary measure to nourish one's own body by the flesh of another. Animals don't want to die; the hunter must overcome the hunted's survival defenses. 

Hunting is primitive & natural, and undeniable part of our human heritage, from the earliest humans who ganged up and hunted with rocks and spears, to recent American history, in which frontiersman and pioneers nourished themselves in the rugged wilderness with game plentiful
 year-round. We are opportunistic and versatile predators, and the consumption of meat is a vital part of our biological and historical identity. 

My relationship with hunting is far from that of those who demolished the legionary bison herds in the nineteenth century, or those who continue to pay top dollar to kill exotic species on reservations alongside tourists. 

One of the many costs of civilization is the separation of human individuals from the mess -- the blood, the sweat, the death -- that maintaining their existence entails. 

*To hunt is to confront in full force the blood and death that is required to sustain a life. Hunting offers deep connection and requires full recognition of our mortal reality.*

Anti-hunters who eat meat should hunt, or else quit eating meat. 

Store-bought, mass-produced meat, comes out of a factory that is operating at a level of scale and efficiency of industrial auto manufacturer. Animals are treated as a mathematical system, balanced to the end of human consumption with the introduction of biologically-incorrect feed, pandemic
-catalyzing antibiotics, mass-captivity, and ultimately the complete denial of an existence true to its animal identity. 

The price of convenient meat is hidden from the mainstream consumer -- this obscurity perpetuates it.  This isolation that individuals from the costs of their decisions is the source of many ails of progress, starting with inhumane commoditization of sentient life & mass pollution of air and
 waterways. 

Eating meat, is, in the modern times of industrial agriculture, unnecessary. But is it harmful? It depends

If meat is raised in a confined animal feeding operations (CAFO's), where animals live in proximity, in mud of their own feces, and must be injected regularly with antibiotics and hormones to keep them alive and growing at breakneck pace under such conditions, yes. It is bad for the animals, as they
 are denied an instinctual existence and can never can do what they were created to do. It is bad for the environment, as such mono-cultures lack the symbiosis of a diverse cyclical ecosystem. And, despite the paid-for denial of the FDA/USDA, meat produced in this way is likely
  bad for us, interfering with hormonal balance now and evolving "super bug" bacteria that will created future pandemics.
 
Most meat is raised under these or similar circumstances. But this disgust and tragedy has been revealed, and given momentum to the "green", "organic", "free-range" movements. While these shifts in farming practice are a step in the right direction, they have been thoroughly manipulated and
 bought out by the industry, and have become hardly more than a brand, a virtue signal. 
 
 Hunted game animals, born and raised in the wild, are free from all human intervention and manipulation. There are no financial interests mediating the relationships between you and them, or concealing the meat that will enter your body behind guarded doors. They are in the wild; one
  only needs interact with the wild to get them. 
 
 *To hunt is to sustain oneself independently, and free of the deceit and damage of industrial agriculture's financial interests and their obedient bureaucracy.*
