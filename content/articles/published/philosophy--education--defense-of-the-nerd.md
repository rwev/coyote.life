Title: In Defense of the Nerd

It's okay to be unpopular.

Popularity seems to be falsely thought of as an intrinsic trait or characteristic, the existence of which is or isn't and must be accepted. 

To excel at something, whether science, business, family life, or popularity, one must allocate their personal resources to it. Self determination rules: the popular kids thinking about being popular, while the smart kids are thinking about being smart.

To be popular to or be smart? A student's capital, whether time or energy or emotional grit, is scarce. Kids make this allocation themselves, even if under the supervision of parents and mentors.

This is confusing, especially considering the insecure and vulnerable period of life high school takes place in.  Many don't realize the commitment that being popular takes, instead taking it personally, as if unpopular means in some way defective. 

> There is a strong correlation between being smart and being a nerd... being smart seems to make you unpopular.<br><br>The main reason nerds are unpopular is that they have other things to think about... Few smart kids can spare the attention that popularity requires... popularity is not something you can do in your spare time.<br><br> In general, people outside some very demanding field don’t realize the extent to which success depends on constant (though often unconscious) effort...Likewise, popular isn’t just something you are or you aren’t, but something you make yourself.

In making the allocation of resources, consider the suitability of the nerd for surviving in the real world.

> While the nerds were being trained to get the right answers, the popular kids were being trained to please... It’s no longer enough just to be pleasing. It starts to be important to get the right answers.

It is not necessarily true that nerds fit better in the real world; rather, participating in central social structures is optional. One can _choose_ to constrain themselves to cliques that resemble the high-school parallel society by being a meathead or a gossiping house wife. It's isolated bubbles that "degenerate into savagery."

In high school society, nerds are often too small of a force to form a formidable social clique. But in a real-life sized pool, nerds "can achieve a critical mass if they clump together" and form groups where intelligence is the social currency.

Nerds should recognize that the situation they are in isn't their fault, and to hold steady until they are released from the high school [prison](https://coyote.life/of-schools-prisons.html). For now, choose your battles. 

> Nerds aren’t losers. They’re just playing a different game, and a game much closer to the one played in the real world. Adults know this. It’s hard to find successful adults now who don’t claim to have been nerds in high school.
